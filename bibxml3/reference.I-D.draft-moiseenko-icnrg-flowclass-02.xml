<abstract><t>For the ubiquitous and highly important Internet protocols (TCP, UDP, IP), flows are conventionally identified by the "5-tuple" of source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port, and protocol type in an IP packet.  Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm where network communications are accomplished by requesting named content, instead of sending packets to destination addresses.  This document describes mechanisms allowing ICN forwarders, consumers, producers and other ICN nodes to encode, decode, and process equivalence class identifiers (flows) at any desired granularity of a routable name prefix and beyond the routable name prefix.  This document is a product of the IRTF Information- Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</t></abstract>
