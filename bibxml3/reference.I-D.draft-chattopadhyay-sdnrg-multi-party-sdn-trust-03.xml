<abstract><t>This draft analyzes the complexities involved in setting up the certification infrastructure for multi-tenant, multi-domain SDN adopted network environment. There are certain architectural options available to address these complexities, and the same have been consolidated and analyzed in the draft. However, there are certain implementation level challenges that create difficulties to operationalize these options. And these challenges have been recognized in the draft and further translated into requirements for setting up an operational framework suitable for managing certificate chains for SDN integrated environment. Finally, a next level of assessment has been carried out to consolidate contemporary work happening in different Work Groups and their likely coverage over identified operational framework requirements.</t></abstract>
