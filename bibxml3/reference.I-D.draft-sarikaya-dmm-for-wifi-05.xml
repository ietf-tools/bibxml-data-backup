<abstract><t>As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed approach is needed to mobility management.  This document presents a use case distributed mobility management protocol called Distributed Mobility Management for Wi-Fi.  The protocol is based on mobility aware virtualized routing system with software-defined network support.  Routing is in Layer 2 in the access network and in Layer 3 in the core network.  Smart phones access the network over IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) interface and can move in home, hotspot and enterprise buildings.</t></abstract>
