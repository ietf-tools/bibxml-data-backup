<abstract><t>This document specifies a fast reroute framework for protecting MPLS tunnels and IP/MPLS services against egress router failures.  In this framework, the penultimate-hop router of an MPLS tunnel pre- establishes a bypass tunnel to a protector, and performs local detection and local repair upon an egress router failure.  The router can restore service traffic in the order of tens of milliseconds, by rerouting the traffic through the bypass tunnel.  The protector in turn performs context label switching or IP forwarding to send the traffic towards service destination(s).  The mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to the failure and control plane protocols converge on the topology changes due to the failure.</t></abstract>
