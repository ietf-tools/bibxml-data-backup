<abstract><t>Section 4.3.5.1 of [RFC6781] "DNSSEC Operational Practices, version 2" describes a procedure for transitioning a DNSSEC signed zone from one (cooperative) operator to another.  The procedure works well in many situations, but makes the assumption that it is feasible for the two operators to simultaneously publish slightly different versions of the zone being transferred.  In some cases, such as with TLD registries, operational considerations require both operators to publish identical versions of the zone for the duration of the transition.  This document describes a modified transition procedure which can be used in these cases.</t></abstract>
