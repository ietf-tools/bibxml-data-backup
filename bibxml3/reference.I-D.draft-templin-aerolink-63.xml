<abstract><t>This document specifies the operation of IP over tunnel virtual links using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO).  Nodes attached to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services for route optimization.  AERO provides an IPv6 link-local address format known as the AERO address that supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links IPv6 ND to IP forwarding.  Admission control, provisioning and mobility are supported by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), and route optimization is naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates.  Although DHCPv6 and IPv6 ND messaging are used in the control plane, both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported in the data plane.  AERO is a widely-applicable tunneling solution using standard control messaging exchanges as described in this document.</t></abstract>
