<abstract><t>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is focused on how to serve time critical flow with low data loss and bounded delay. Unlike contemporary solution which improves QoS such as TE, redundant bandwidth provisioning and dedicated channel reservation, DetNet provides more general approaches that use IP-based techniques and guarantee the worst-case latency of DetNet flows while allowing sharing among best-effort flows. For this purpose, DetNet may require upgraded or redefined data plane as well as control plane, since current networking cannot assure maximum end-to-end latency. This document describes some technical requirements on possible data plane, control plane and DetNet flow modeling that can help to clarify those capabilities DetNet should have.</t></abstract>
