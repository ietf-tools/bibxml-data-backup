<abstract><t>The Real-Time Communications on the Web (RTCWEB) working group is tasked with standardizing protocols for real-time communications between Web browsers, generally called "WebRTC".  The major use cases for WebRTC technology are real-time audio and/or video calls, Web conferencing, and direct data transfer.  Unlike most conventional real-time systems (e.g., SIP-based soft phones) WebRTC communications are directly controlled by a Web server, which poses new security challenges.  For instance, a Web browser might expose a JavaScript API which allows a server to place a video call.  Unrestricted access to such an API would allow any site which a user visited to "bug" a user's computer, capturing any activity which passed in front of their camera.  This document defines the WebRTC threat model and analyzes the security threats of WebRTC in that model.</t></abstract>
