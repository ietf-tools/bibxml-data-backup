<abstract><t>When small payloads are transmitted through a packet-switched network, the resulting overhead may result significant.  This is stressed in the case of LISP, where a number of headers have to be added to each packet.  This document proposes to send together, into a single packet, a number of small packets, which are in the buffer of a ITR, having the same ETR as destination.  This way, they will share a single LISP header, and therefore bandwidth savings can be obtained, and a reduction in the overall number of packets sent to the network can be achieved.</t></abstract>
