<abstract><t>This document is a compilation of issues found since the publication of RFC4960 in September 2007 based on experience with implementing, testing, and using SCTP along with the suggested fixes.  This document provides deltas to RFC4960 and is organized in a time ordered way.  The issues are listed in the order they were brought up.  Because some text is changed several times the last delta in the text is the one which should be applied.  In addition to the delta a description of the problem and the details of the solution are also provided.</t></abstract>
