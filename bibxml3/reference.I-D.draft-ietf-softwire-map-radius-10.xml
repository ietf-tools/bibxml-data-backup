<abstract><t>IPv4-over-IPv6 transition mechanisms provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) options have been defined to configure Customer Edge (CE) in MAP-E, MAP-T, and Lightweight 4over6.  However, in many networks, the configuration information may be stored in the Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers, while user configuration is mainly provided by the Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through the DHCPv6 protocol.  This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries CE configuration information from the AAA server to the BNG.</t></abstract>
