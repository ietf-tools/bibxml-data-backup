<abstract><t>The emerging multi-domain applications, such as flexible interdomain routing, distributed, federated machine learning and multi-domain collaborative dataset transfer, can benefit substantially from getting information from networks.  The ALTO base protocol [RFC7285] provides a northbound interface for applications to retrieve the network information.  In particular, it specifies the communication between an ALTO client and an ALTO server, where the ALTO is implicitly assumed to be able to answer any query from the ALTO client.  However, it does not specify the cases when the network information are originated from multiple domains (i.e., administrative entities or geographically partitions).  This document summarizes the discussion on the ALTO weekly meeting since IETF 108 on how to extend ALTO to support multi-domain applications.  It identifies the key challenges for retrieving network information from multiple networks, reviews the existing efforts in the work group, and discusses the next steps to fully address the challenges.</t></abstract>
