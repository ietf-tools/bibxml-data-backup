<abstract><t>An RFC can include a tag called &quot;Updates&quot; which can be used to link a new RFC to an existing RFC.  On publication of such an RFC, the existing RFC will include an additional metadata tag called &quot;Updated by&quot; which provides a link to the new RFC.  However, this tag pair is not well-defined and therefore it is currently used for multiple different purposes, which leads to confusion about the actual meaning of this tag and inconsistency in its use.</t><t> This document recommends the discontinuation of the use of the updates/updated by tag pair, and instead proposes three new tag pairs that have well-defined meanings and use cases.</t></abstract>
