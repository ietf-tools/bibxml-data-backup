<abstract><t>The WebTransport Protocol Framework enables clients constrained by the Web security model to communicate with a remote server using a secure multiplexed transport.  It consists of a set of individual protocols that are safe to expose to untrusted applications, combined with a model that allows them to be used interchangeably.</t><t> This document defines the overall requirements on the protocols used in WebTransport, as well as the common features of the protocols, support for some of which may be optional.</t></abstract>
