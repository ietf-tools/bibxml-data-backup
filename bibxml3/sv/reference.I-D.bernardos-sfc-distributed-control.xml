<abstract><t>Service function chaining (SFC) allows the instantiation of an ordered set of service functions and subsequent &quot;steering&quot; of traffic through them.  In order to set up and maintain SFC instances, a control plane is required, which typically is centralized.  In certain environments, such as fog computing ones, such centralized control might not be feasible, calling for distributed SFC control solutions.  This document introduces the role of SFC pseudo- controller and specifies solutions to select and initialize such new logical function.</t></abstract>
