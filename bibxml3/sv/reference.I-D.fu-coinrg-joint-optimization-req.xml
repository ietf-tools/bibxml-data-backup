<abstract><t>With the development of edge computing, there is a trend that computing is widely deployed in network rather than at other end of network, and provides services at nearer location.  With the deep integration of network, traditional optimization and scheduling within network domain is not enough, the endpoint of the path matters a lot.  So the relationship between computing and network are new and important topics to be studied.  This document focus on the requirements of computing and network joint optimization and scheduling based on the newly arising service requirements.</t></abstract>
