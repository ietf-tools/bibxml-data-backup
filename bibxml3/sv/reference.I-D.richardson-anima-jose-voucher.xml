<abstract><t>RFC8366 defines a digital artifact called voucher as a YANG-defined JSON document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) structure.  This memo introduces a variant of the voucher structure in which CMS is replaced by the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) mechanism described in RFC7515 to better support use-cases in which JOSE is preferred over CMS.</t><t> In addition to explaining how the format is created, MIME types are registered and examples are provided.</t></abstract>
