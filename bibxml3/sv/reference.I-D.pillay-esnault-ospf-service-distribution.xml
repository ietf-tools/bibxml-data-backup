<abstract><t>The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is used to carry data on behalf of other services using the Opaque Link State Advertisements. The protocol's flooding mechanism is well suited to cover the data propagation requirements of services such as Traffic Engineering. However, the current mechanism cannot scale for a large number of services nor satisfy some of their new set of requirements.  This document describes a new mechanism in OSPF to support service and data distribution for a large number of services, computation of preferred service access points and a controlled service data exchange.</t></abstract>
