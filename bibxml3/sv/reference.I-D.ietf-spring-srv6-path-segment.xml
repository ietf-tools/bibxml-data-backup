<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths by encoding an ordered list of instructions, called &quot;segments&quot;. The SR architecture can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well as an IPv6 data plane.</t><t> Currently, Path Segment has been defined to identify an SR path in SR-MPLS networks, and is used for various use-cases such as end-to- end SR Path Protection and Performance Measurement (PM) of an SR path.  This document defines the Path Segment to identify an SRv6 path in an IPv6 network.</t></abstract>
