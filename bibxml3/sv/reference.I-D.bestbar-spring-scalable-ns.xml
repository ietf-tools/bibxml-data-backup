<abstract><t>Multiple network slices can be realized on top of a single shared network.  A router that requires forwarding of a packet that belongs to a slice aggregate may have to decide on the forwarding action to take based on selected next-hop(s), and the forwarding treatment (e.g., scheduling and drop policy) to enforce based on the slice aggregate per-hop behavior.  Segment Routing is a technology that enables the steering of packets in a network by encoding pre- established segments within the network into the packet header.  This document introduces mechanisms to enable forwarding of packets over a specific slice aggregate along a Segment Routing (SR) path.</t></abstract>
