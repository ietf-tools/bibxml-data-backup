<abstract><t>DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] describes a mechanism for dynamically configuring IPv4 over an IPv6-only network.  For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms and deployment scenarios, the operator must learn the /128 IPv6 address that the client will use as the source of IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel.  This address, in conjunction with the IPv4 address and the Port Set ID allocated to the DHCP 4o6 client are used to create a binding table entry in the softwire tunnel concentrator.  This memo defines two DHCPv6 options used to communicate the source tunnel IPv6 address between the DHCP 4o6 client and server.  It also describes a method for configuring the client with the IPv6 address of the border router so that the softwire can be established.  It is designed to work in conjunction with the IPv4 address allocation process.</t></abstract>
