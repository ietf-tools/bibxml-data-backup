<abstract><t>This document describes the use of the error performance metric to characterize a packet-switched network's conformance to the pre- defined set of performance objectives.  In this document, metrics that characterize error performance in a packet-switched network (PSN) are defined, as well as methods to measure and calculate them. Also, the requirements for an active Operation, Administration, and Maintenance protocol to support the error performance measurement in PSN are discussed, and potential candidate protocols are analyzed. All metrics and measurement methods are equally applicable to underlay and overlay networks.</t></abstract>
