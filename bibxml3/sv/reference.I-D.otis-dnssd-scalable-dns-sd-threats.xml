<abstract><t>mDNS combined with Service Discovery (DNS-SD) extends network resource distribution beyond the reach of multicast normally limited by the MAC Bridge.  Since related resources are often not authenticated, either local resources are inherently trustworthy or are subsequently verified by associated services.  Resource distribution becomes complex when a hybrid scheme combines adjacent network resources into a common unicast DNS-SD structure.  This document explores related security considerations.</t></abstract>
