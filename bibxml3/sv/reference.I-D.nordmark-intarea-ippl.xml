<abstract><t>IP makes certain assumptions about the L2 forwarding behavior of a multi-access IP link.  However, there are several forms of intentional partitioning of links ranging from split-horizon to Private VLANs that violate some of those assumptions.  This document specifies that link behavior and how IP handles links with those properties.</t></abstract>
