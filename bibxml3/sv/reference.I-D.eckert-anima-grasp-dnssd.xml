<abstract><t>DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) defines a framework for applications to announce and discover services.  This includes service names, service instance names, common parameters for selecting a service instance (weight or priority) as well as other service-specific parameters.  For the specific case of autonomic networks, GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) intends to be used for service discovery in addition to the setup of basic connectivity. Reinventing advanced service discovery for GRASP with a similar set of features as DNS-SD would result in duplicated work.  To avoid that, this document defines how to use GRASP to announce and discover services relying upon DNS-SD features while maintaining the intended simplicity of GRASP.  To that aim, the document defines name discovery and schemes for reusable elements in GRASP objectives.</t></abstract>
