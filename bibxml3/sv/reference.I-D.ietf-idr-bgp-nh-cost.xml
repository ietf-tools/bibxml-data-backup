<abstract><t>BGPLS provides a mechanism by which Link state and traffic engineering information can be collected from internal networks and shared with external network routers using BGP.  BGPLS defines a new Address Family to exchange this information using BGP.</t><t> BGP Optimal Route Reflection [BGP-ORR] [RFC9107] provides a mechanism for a centralized BGP Route Reflector to acheive requirements of a Hot Potato Routing as described in Section 11 of [RFC4456].  Optimal Route Reflection requires BGP ORR to overwrite the default IGP location placement of the route reflector; which is used for determining cost to the nexthop contained in the path.</t><t> This draft augments BGPLS and defines a new extensions to exchange cost information to next-hops for the purpose of calculating best path from a peer perspective rather than local BGP speaker own perspective.</t></abstract>
