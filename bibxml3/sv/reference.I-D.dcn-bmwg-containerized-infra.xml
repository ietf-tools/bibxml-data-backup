<abstract><t>This draft describes considerations for benchmarking network performance in containerized infrastructures.  In the containerized infrastructure, Virtualized Network Functions(VNFs) are deployed on an operating-system-level virtualization platform by abstracting the user namespace as opposed to virtualization using a hypervisor. Hence, the system configurations and networking scenarios for benchmarking will be partially changed by how the resource allocation and network technologies are specified for containerized VNFs.  This draft compares the state of the art in the container networking architecture with VM-based virtualized systems networking architecture and provides several test scenarios for benchmarking network performance in containerized infrastructures.</t></abstract>
