<abstract><t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and XMPP.  Over the years, the industry has witnessed several serious attacks on TLS and DTLS, including attacks on the most commonly used cipher suites and their modes of operation.  This document provides the latest recommendations for ensuring the security of deployed services that use TLS and DTLS.  These recommendations are applicable to the majority of use cases.</t><t> An earlier version of this document was published as RFC 7525 when the industry was in the midst of its transition to TLS 1.2.  Years later this transition is largely complete and TLS 1.3 is widely available.  This document updates the guidance given the new environment and obsoletes RFC 7525.  In addition, the document updates RFC 5288 and RFC 6066 in view of recent attacks.</t></abstract>
