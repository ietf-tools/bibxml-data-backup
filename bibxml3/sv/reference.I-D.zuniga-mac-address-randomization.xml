<abstract><t>Internet privacy has become a major concern over the past few years. Users are becoming more aware that their online activity leaves a vast digital footprint, that communications are not always properly secured, and that their location and actions can be easily tracked. One of the main factors for the location tracking issue is the wide use of long-lasting identifiers, such as MAC addresses.</t><t> There have been several initiatives at the IETF and the IEEE 802 standards committees to overcome some of these privacy issues.  This document provides an overview of these activities, with the intention to inform the technical community about them, and help coordinate between present and futures standardization activities.</t></abstract>
