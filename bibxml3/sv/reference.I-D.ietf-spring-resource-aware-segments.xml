<abstract><t>This document describes the mechanism to associate network resource attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs).  Such SIDs are referred to as resource-aware SIDs in this document.  The resource- aware SIDs retain their original forwarding semantics, but with the additional semantics to identify the set of network resources available for the packet processing action.  The resource-aware SIDs can therefore be used to build SR paths or virtual networks with a set of reserved network resources.  The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t></abstract>
