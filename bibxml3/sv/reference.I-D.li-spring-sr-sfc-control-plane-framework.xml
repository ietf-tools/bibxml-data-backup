<abstract><t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called &quot;segments&quot;.  Segment routing architecture can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well as an IPv6 data plane.</t><t> Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides support for the creation of composite services that consist of an ordered set of Service Functions (SF) that are to be applied to packets and/or frames selected as a result of classification.</t><t> SFC can be implemented based on several technologies, such as Network Service Header (NSH) and SR.  This document describes a framework for constructing SFC based on Segment Routing.  The document reviews the control plane solutions for route distribution of service function instance and service function path, and steering packets into a service function chain.</t></abstract>
