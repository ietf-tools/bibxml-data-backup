<abstract><t>This document specifies Circuit Breaker Assisted Congestion Control (CBACC).  CBACC enables fast-trip Circuit Breakers by publishing rate metadata about multicast channels from senders to intermediate network nodes or receivers.  The circuit breaker behavior is defined as a supplement to receiver driven congestion control systems, to preserve network health if misbehaving or malicious receiver applications subscribe to a volume of traffic that exceeds capacity policies or capability for a network or receiving device.</t></abstract>
