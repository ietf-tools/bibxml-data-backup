<abstract><t>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models in the Internet of Things.  It was created as a common language for use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization (OneDM) definitions.  Tools convert this format to database formats and other serializations as needed.</t><t> An SDF specification describes definitions of SDF Objects and their associated interactions (Events, Actions, Properties), as well as the Data types for the information exchanged in those interactions.</t><t></t><t> // A JSON format representation of SDF 1.0 was defined in version // (-00) of this document; version (-05) was designated as an // _implementation draft_, labeled SDF 1.1, at the IETF110 meeting of // the ASDF WG (2021-03-11).  The present version (-11) collects a // few smaller changes as input to the 2022-02-28 ASDF WG interim. // It also removes deprecated elements from SDF 1.0.</t></abstract>
