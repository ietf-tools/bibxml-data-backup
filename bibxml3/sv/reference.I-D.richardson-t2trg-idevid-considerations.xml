<abstract><t>This document provides a taxonomy of methods used by manufacturers of silicon and devices to secure private keys and public trust anchors. This deals with two related activities: how trust anchors and private keys are installed into devices during manufacturing, and how the related manufacturer held private keys are secured against disclosure.</t><t> This document does not evaluate the different mechanisms, but rather just serves to name them in a consistent manner in order to aid in communication.</t><t> RFCEDITOR: please remove this paragraph.
