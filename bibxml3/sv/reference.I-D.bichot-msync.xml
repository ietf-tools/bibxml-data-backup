<abstract><t>This document describes the  Multicast Synchronization (MSYNC) Protocol that aims at transferring video media objects over IP multicast operating preferably RTP. Although generic, MSYNC has been primarily designed for transporting HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) objects including manifest/playlists and media segments (e.g. MP4, CMAF) according to an HAS protocol such as Apple HLS or MPEG DASH between a multicast server and a multicast gateway.</t></abstract>
