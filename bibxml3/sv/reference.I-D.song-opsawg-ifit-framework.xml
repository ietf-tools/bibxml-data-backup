<abstract><t>As network scale increases and network operation becomes more sophisticated, traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include proactive and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes, are no longer sufficient to meet the monitoring and measurement requirements.  Data-plane on-path telemetry techniques which provide high-precision flow insight and real-time issue notification are emerging to support suitable quality of experience for users and applications, and network fault or deficiency identification.</t><t> Centering on the new data-plane on-path telemetry techniques, this document outlines a high-level framework to provide an operational environment that utilizes these techniques to enable the collection and correlation of performance measurement information from the network.  The framework identifies the components that are needed to coordinate the existing protocol tools and telemetry mechanisms, and addresses key deployment challenges for flow-oriented on-path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier networks.</t><t> The framework is informational and intended to guide system designers attempting to apply the referenced techniques as well as to motivate further work to enhance the ecosystem.</t></abstract>
