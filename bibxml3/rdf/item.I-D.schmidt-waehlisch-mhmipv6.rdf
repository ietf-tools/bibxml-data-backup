    <title>"Seamless Multicast Handover in a Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Environment  (M-HMIPv6)", Thomas Schmidt, Matthias Waehlisch</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schmidt-waehlisch-mhmipv6-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document extends the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Internet Draft to include the reception and transmission of Any Source Multicast traffic at the Mobile Node. It introduces handover mechanisms for IPv6 mobile multicast listeners and mobile multicast senders. Operations are based on a Mobile IPv6 environment with local mobility anchor points. These local anchor points are conformal with a Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 proxy infrastructure. Handover latencies in the proposed scheme remain bound to link switching delays with respect to these local proxy points. Thus the M-HMIPv6 achieves seamless mobility, even though no bicasting of multicast streams is used. Multicast listeners in addition encounter the option to optimize multicast routing by turning to a direct data reception. The mechanisms described in this document do not rely on assumptions of any specific multicast routing protocol in use. The M-HMIPv6 protocol operations utilize the existing HMIPv6, MIPv6 and MLDv2 messages under minor extensions.</description>
