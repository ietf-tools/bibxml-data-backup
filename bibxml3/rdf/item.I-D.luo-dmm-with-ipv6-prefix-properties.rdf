    <title>"Distributed Mobility Management Approaches with IPv6 Prefix Properties", Wen Luo, Tricci So</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-luo-dmm-with-ipv6-prefix-properties-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft extends the existing PMIP-based mobility management protocol to support a more distributed model by introducing two new logical functions to enable distributed anchoring and location management.  Given the consideration that, the MN may not always require the mobility support that requires the use of the global prefix and additional network resources, this draft supports the option to leverage the extended properties of IPv6 prefixes source address selection hint (i.e.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol and its Prefix Information Option) to enable the UE's selection of IPv6 prefix according to its service/application's mobility support requirement.  When the extended prefix properties feature is supported by the MN, this draft enable the MN to select the appropriate prefix according to the mechanism as described in [I-D.korhonen-dmm-prefix-properties].  Once the IPv6 prefix is determined, the rest of the DMM mechanism is similar to the luo draft [I-D.luo-dmm-pmip-based-dmm-approach].</description>
