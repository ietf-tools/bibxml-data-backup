    <description>Mobile IPv6 enables a Mobile Node to maintain its connectivity to the Internet when moving from an Access Router to another, a process referred to as handover. During handover, there is a period when the Mobile Node is unable to send or receive packets due to both link switching delay and IP protocol operations. This ``handover latency'' resulting from standard Mobile IPv6 procedures, namely movement detection, new Care of Address configuration and Binding Update, is often unacceptable to real-time traffic such as Voice over IP. Reducing the handover latency could be beneficial to non real-time, throughput-sensitive applications as well. This document specifies a protocol to improve handover latency due to Mobile IPv6 procedures. This document does not address improving the link switching latency.</description>
