    <title>"INTERNET MESSAGE ACCESS PROTOCOL - VERSION 4rev2", Alexey Melnikov</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-melnikov-imap4rev2-08.txt</link>
    <description>The Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev2 (IMAP4rev2) allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server.  IMAP4rev2 permits manipulation of mailboxes (remote message folders) in a way that is functionally equivalent to local folders.  IMAP4rev2 also provides the capability for an offline client to resynchronize with the server.  IMAP4rev2 includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, RFC 5322 and RFC 2045 parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof.  Messages in IMAP4rev2 are accessed by the use of numbers. These numbers are either message sequence numbers or unique identifiers.  IMAP4rev2 does not specify a means of posting mail; this function is handled by a mail submission protocol such as RFC 6409.</description>
