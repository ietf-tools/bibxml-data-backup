    <description>This memo presents the specification of Dynamic Service Negotiation Protocol (DSNP). DSNP is a protocol to negotiate the SLS (Service Level Specification) in IP layer. It can be used for service negotiation from host to network, network to host, and network to network. The automated negotiation makes service negotiation efficient in terms of time, cost, and correctness, etc. The dynamic negotiation not only allows users to adapt their needs dynamically, but also let providers better utilize the network. The DSNP messages and packet formats are detailed. DSNP can be used in both wireline and wireless networks. It is, however, particularly useful in mobile environment. To demonstrate the usefulness of DSNP, a reference wireless QoS architecture is presented. Exemplary applications are illustrated.</description>
