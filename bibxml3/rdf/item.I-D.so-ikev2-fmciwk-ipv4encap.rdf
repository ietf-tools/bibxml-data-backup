    <title>"Problem Statement of IPv4 Private Addressing Support for Fixed Mobile Convergence over IPSec Tunneling", Tricci So</title>

    <description>IPSec IKEv2, RFC 5996 [RFC5996], has been adopted by many standardized network solutions to provide the secure transport between network elements over third party's infrastructure.  For example, the emerging Fixed Mobile Convergence (FMC) network solution that involves Femtocell deployment requires the mobile operator's Femtocell AP to leverage the IPSec IKEv2 to support mutual authentication and remote IP address configuration as well as other auto configuration support over the broadband fixed network (BBF) of which the mobile and fixed networks may be operated by two different operators.  Most of today broadband fixed networks are still relying on the IPv4 private addressing plan to support its attached devices including the mobile operator's Femtocell AP.  Hence, the private IPv4 addressing and Network Address and Port Translation (NA(P)T) support mostly likely stays for many years to come.  In FMC interworking scenario, there is a need for the mobile network to pass on it mobile subscribers' policies to the broadband fixed network (BBF) to maintain the service level agreement (SLA) and to support remote network management. In addition, a broadband fixed network (BBF) may partnership with more than one mobile operator. Therefore it is important for the BBF and the mobile network to be able to overcome the limitation of the private IPv4 addressing and to be able to identify the user's subscription as well as to determine the location of the Femtocell AP that serves its mobile user over the BBF network.  This document presents the problems for the IPSec tunneling support with private IPv4 addressing for FMC interworking and proposes a simple extension to the IKEv2 to resolve the issues.</description>
