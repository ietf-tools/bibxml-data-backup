    <description>Network administrators typically provision QoS policies for their application traffic (such as voice, video) based on SLAs negotiated with their providers, and translate those SLAs to vendor specific configuration language.  Both learning of SLA, either thru SLA documents or via some other out-of-band method, and translating them to vendor specific configuration language is a complex, many times manual, process and prone to errors.  This document proposes an in- band method of SLA signaling which can help to simplify some of the complexities.  This document defines an operational transitive attribute to signal SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as Autonomous Systems (AS)), and thus simplify/speed-up some of the complex tasks.  Though the use-case with the proposed attribute is explicitly defined in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this use-case only.</description>
