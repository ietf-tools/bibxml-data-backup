    <description>Tunnel is one typical service provided by carrier IP network. Network Tunnel service model can provide the northbound interface of network-level tunnel service of the controller to try to simplify the Tunnel provision without involving too much details of Tunnel implementation on the device.  This document gives exploratory description about the requirement of network-level Tunnel service and how to define the data model which will provide the guidance for the future definition of the concrete data model.</description>
