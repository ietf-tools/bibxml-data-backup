    <title>"MPLS-TP Network Management Framework", Scott Mansfield, Eric Gray, Hing-Kam Lam</title>

    <description>This document provides the network management framework for the Transport Profile for Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP).  This framework relies on the management terminology from the ITU-T to describe the management architecture that could be used for an MPLS-TP management network.  The management of the MPLS-TP network could be based on multi-tiered distributed management systems.  This document provides a description of the network and element management architectures that could be applied and also describes heuristics associated with fault, configuration, and performance aspects of the management system.  This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.  This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETF Last Call.  [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF Consensus.]</description>
