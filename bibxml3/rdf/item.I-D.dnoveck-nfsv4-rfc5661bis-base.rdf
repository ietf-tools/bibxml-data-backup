        <title>"Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 Protocol", David Noveck, Chuck Lever</title>
        <dc:date>2021-07-06T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 7530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  The later minor version has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and is considered a separate protocol.  This document obsoletes RFC 5661.  It substantially revises the treatment of features relating to multi-server namespace, superseding the description of those features appearing in RFC 5661.  The content of this document reflects that of RFC8881, presented in the form of an I-D.  This is intended to provide a helpful point of comparision for drafts leading to an eventual rfc5661bis document suite.  This document can serve as a baseline to enable use of rfcdiff when reviewing such drafts.</description>
