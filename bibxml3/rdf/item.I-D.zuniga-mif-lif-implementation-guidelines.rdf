    <title>"Logical Interface (LIF) Implementation Guidelines", Juan Zuniga, Telemaco Melia</title>

    <description>A Logical Interface is a software module internal to the host that is available in all popular operating systems. The use of this Logical Interface allows supporting different network-based mobility management solutions. In the NETEXT WG, work has been carried out to define ways in which a Logical Interface can help IP flow mobility (IFOM) for Proxy Mobile IPv6 [I-D.draft-ietf-netext-logical- interface-support]. The same Logical Interface construct can help other mobility management solutions like 3GPP GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP), and it can add benefits to multi-access scenarios such as 3GPP Multi Access PDN Connectivity (MAPCON). This document provides guidelines for the implementation and configuration of a generic Logical Interface.</description>
