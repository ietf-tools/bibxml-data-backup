    <title>"ECDH-based Authentication using Pre-Shared Asymmetric Keypairs for (Datagram) Transport Layer Security ((D)TLS) Protocol version 1.2", Tony Putman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-putman-tls-preshared-ecdh-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines a new mutual authentication method for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2.  The authentication method requires that the client and server are each pre-provisioned with a unique asymmetric Elliptic Curve Diffie- Hellman (ECDH) keypair and with the public ECDH key of the peer.  The handshake provides ephemeral ECDH keys, and a premaster key is agreed using Double- or Triple-ECDH; confirmation of possession of this key provides mutual authentication.  Multiple new cipher suites which use this authentication method are specified.</description>
