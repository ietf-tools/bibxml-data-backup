    <title>"Requirements for Ad Hoc IP Address Autoconfiguration", Jae-Hoon Jeong</title>

    <description>Ad hoc network has no built-in infra-structure for communication among mobile nodes and operates in a stand-alone fashion, or may be connected to the public Internet. The nodes in ad hoc network need to have the capability to maintain or share all the resources of the network in a distributed fashion. One of the most important resources is the set of IP addresses configured with an addressing scheme. When a new node joins an ad hoc network, it has to be assigned a unique IP address or autoconfigure its own IP address as part of its initialization. Since ad hoc network's topology may change unpredictably, it is important to provide a resilient method for providing mobile nodes with such an IP address autoconfiguration in distributive environments. This document specifies the requirements for IP address autoconfiguration in ad hoc networks which have dynamic network topology.</description>
