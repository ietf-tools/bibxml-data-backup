    <description>In this paper, we discuss the delay-constrained energy efficient multicast routing problem in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. A cognitive radio ad hoc network is a wireless multi-hop network established by secondary users on varying available spectrum bands. The routing research is a hotspot in the field of cognitive radio ad hoc networks. However, multicast routing algorithm study of cognitive radio ad hoc networks is still in starting stage. In this paper, we proposed a novel delay-constrained energy efficient multicast routing algorithm (DCEEMR) in cognitive radio ad hoc networks. The DCEEMR guarantees that the multicast tree can be found if it exists, and the multicast tree satisfies the delay bound and has low energy consuming. The algorithm uses delay-energy function to construct the multicast tree based on the spectrum selection. Through an example with randomly network topology, we demonstrate that our algorithm is better in terms of energy cost of multicast tree as compared to the existing algorithm QoS Dependent Multicast Routing (QDMR). Moreover, the algorithm does not suffer from high complexity common to the algorithm QDMR. Experiment results by NS-2 show that the delay and tree cost are lower than well-known Multicast ad- hoc On-demand Distance Vector (MAODV) protocol.</description>
