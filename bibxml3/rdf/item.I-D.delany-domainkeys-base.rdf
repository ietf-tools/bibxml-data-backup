    <title>"Domain-based Email Authentication Using Public Keys Advertised in the DNS  (DomainKeys)", Mark Delany</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-delany-domainkeys-base-06.txt</link>
    <description>"DomainKeys" creates a domain-level authentication framework for email by using public key technology and the DNS to prove the provenance and contents of an email. This document defines a framework for digitally signing email on a per-domain basis. The ultimate goal of this framework is to unequivocally prove and protect identity while retaining the semantics of Internet email as it is known today. Proof and protection of email identity may assist in the global control of "spam" and "phishing".</description>
