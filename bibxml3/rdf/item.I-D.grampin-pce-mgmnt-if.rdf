    <description>The Path Computation Element (PCE) Architecture provide a framework to support the Constraint-Based Routing (CBR) functionality for traffic engineering systems in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. The model define the PCC and PCE entities at the Control Plane, which communicate using a Request/Reply protocol. The PCE architecture enable network operators a tight control of the resource assignment by means of the administrative constraints that are included in the Traffic Enginnering Database (TED), and used in the path computation process. Moreover, appropriate objective funtions assist operators in the fulfillment of the overall network objectives. This document present a system architecture for the PCE, namely Routing and Management Agent (RMA), with a standard management interface, which permit established management frameworks to rely on the PCE for the CBR functionality and inject network-wide policies into the PCE path computation process. Some reliability issues of the PCE Architecture are addressed in the document.</description>
