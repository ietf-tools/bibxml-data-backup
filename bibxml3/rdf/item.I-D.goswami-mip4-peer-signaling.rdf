    <title>"IPv4 Mobility through Peer Signaling", Subrata Goswami</title>

    <description>This document describes a way to perform mobility in IPv4 (potentially IPv6) without requiring any new entity in networks infrastructure (e.g. Home Agent, Foreign Agent, etc.). Instead of using infrastructure entities this method delegates all the mobility function to the end nodes. The method relies on source and destination address translation at the end nodes, and signaling between end nodes to perform hand offs - all these function can be encapsulated in an entity called Mobility Agent (MA) in the end nodes.</description>
