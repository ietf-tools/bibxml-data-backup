    <description>The requirements of MPLS-TP in RFC 5654 include a requirement(R63) that requires MPLS-TP MUST be possible to provide protection for MPLS-TP data plane without any IP forwarding capability and control plane.If applying 1:1 protection mechanism for the p2mp traffic in rfc6718 , it must have a return path to coordinate switch state to select the same path to receive and send traffic packet.For the above problem,this document describes a kind of protection solution to recovery and protect the p2mp traffic under the failure condition.   This document is a product of a joint Internet Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</description>
