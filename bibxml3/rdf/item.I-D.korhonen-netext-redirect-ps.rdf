    <title>"Proxy Mobile IPv6 Mobility Session Redirection Problem Statement", Jouni  Korhonen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-korhonen-netext-redirect-ps-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses a Proxy Mobile IPv6 mobility session redirection functionality at the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol level.  The redirection functionality would allow a Local Mobility Anchor to redirect the Mobile Access Gateway during the Proxy Binding Update and Acknowledgement exchange to an alternative Local Mobility Anchor.  The benefit of redirection at the protocol level is that it removes the dependence on having such functionality provided by the Authentication, Authorization and, Accounting elements or the Domain Name System in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain.  Furthermore, doing the redirection at the base protocol level reduces the amount of signaling, unnecessary costly setup of mobility sessions and unnecessary costly interactions with backend systems.</description>
