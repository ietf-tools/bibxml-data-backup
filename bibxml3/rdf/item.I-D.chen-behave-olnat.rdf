    <title>"A Optimal Load-balance mechanism for NAT64 (OL-NAT)", Gang Chen, Hui Deng</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-chen-behave-olnat-01.txt</link>
    <description>In NAT64 scenaires,sigle-point failure is a critical issue to restrict large-scale deployment. In order to overcome this hurdle, this memo proposed a optimal load-balance mechanism for NAT64. Through the new-defined evaluation metrics, several extended ICMP messages combining with anycast are performed to achieve optimal NAT64 selection. Meanwihle, the synchroniztion process of IP address mapping information is also designed to guarantee the service continuity.</description>
