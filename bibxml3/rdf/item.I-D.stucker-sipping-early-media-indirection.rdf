    <title>"Early Media INDirection (EMIND) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", Brian Stucker</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-stucker-sipping-early-media-indirection-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes models that can be used to manage multiple early media streams in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The model seeks to allow calling party endpoints to be able to better control the rendering of early media to the user, and distinguish early media from final media. Although some of early media challenges are likely to never be overcome, (e.g. when interworking with an ISUP PSTN gateway that does not take into account CPG or ACM messages), the potential to improve on what is already there does exist. The recommendations in this document are intended to be an update to RFC-3960 recommendations and to avoid many of the complications outlined in draft-stucker-sipping-early-media-coping.</description>
