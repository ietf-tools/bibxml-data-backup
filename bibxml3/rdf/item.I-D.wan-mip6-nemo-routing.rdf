    <title>"Route management of mobile entity with an ipv6 home address roaming into the  ipv4 network", Changsheng Wan</title>

    <description>The current Mobile IPv6 and NEMO specification supports only IPv6. As an extension, the DSMip6 protocol [v4traversal]defines how the dual-stack mobile node roams in the ipv4 network. The dsmip6 protocol assumes that both home agent and mobile node supports mipv4 and mipv6 protocol. It also assumes that both the home agent and mobile node have a configured ipv4 address. These assumptions do work during many scenarios. However, as the ipv4 address is a scarce resource in many counrties, some mobile nodes may not be able to get configured ipv4 home addresses from their home agents. In this scenario, a temporary ipv4 home address is more useful. This document will focuse on this scenario.</description>
