        <title>"Domain-based signing and encryption using S/MIME", William Ottaway, Alexey Melnikov</title>

        <description>The S/MIME protocols Message Specification (RFC 5751), Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 5652), S/MIME Certificate Handling (RFC 5750) and Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME (RFC 2634) specify a consistent way to securely send and receive MIME messages providing end to end integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and confidentiality.  This document identifies a number of interoperability, technical, procedural and policy related issues that may result in end-to-end security services not being achievable.  To resolve such issues, this document profiles domain-based signing and encryption using S/MIME, such as specifying how S/MIME signing and encryption can be applied between a Message Submission Agent (MSA) and a Message Delivery Agent (MDA) or between 2 Message Transfer Agents (MTA).  This document is also registering 2 URI scheme: "smtp" and "submit" which are used for designating SMTP/SMTP Submission servers (respectively), as well as SMTP/Submission client accounts.</description>
