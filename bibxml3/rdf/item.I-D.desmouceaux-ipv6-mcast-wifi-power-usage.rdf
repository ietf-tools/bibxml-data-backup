    <title>"Power consumption due to IPv6 multicast on WiFi devices", Yoann Desmouceaux</title>

    <description>IPv6 networks make a consequent use of multicast for several purposes, including mandatory functions such as Neighbor Discovery. Although this use of multicast does not create real difficulties on wired networks, it can become painful on wireless ones, notably in terms of power consumption.  There might be little effect on home networks, however, such effects become more important on large-scale networks.  This memo provides statistics about the multicast traffic rate in a large IPv6 wireless network and the induced device power consumption, in response to a call emitted at IETF 89.</description>
