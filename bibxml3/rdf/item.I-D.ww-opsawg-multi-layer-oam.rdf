    <description>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) mechanisms are critical building blocks in network operations that are used for service assurance, fulfillment, or service diagnosis, troubleshooting, and repair.  The current practice is that many technologies rely on their own OAM protocols that are exclusive to a given layer.  There is little consolidation of OAM in either data plane or management plane nor well-documented inter-layer OAM operations.  Vendors and Operators dedicate significant resources and effort through the whole OAM life-cycle each time when a new technology is (to be) introduced.  This is even exacerbated when dealing with integration of OAM across multiple technologies.  This document describes the problem space and defines an architecture for the generic and integrated OAM with a focus of multi-layer and cross-layer considerations.</description>
