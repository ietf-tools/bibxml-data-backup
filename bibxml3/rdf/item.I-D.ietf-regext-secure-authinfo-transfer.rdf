        <title>"Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Secure Authorization Information for Transfer", James Gould, Richard Wilhelm</title>

        <description>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), in RFC 5730, defines the use of authorization information to authorize a transfer of an EPP object, such as a domain name, between clients that are referred to as registrars.  Object-specific, password-based authorization information (see RFC 5731 and RFC 5733) is commonly used, but raises issues related to the security, complexity, storage, and lifetime of authentication information.  This document defines an operational practice, using the EPP RFCs, that leverages the use of strong random authorization information values that are short-lived, not stored by the client, and stored by the server using a cryptographic hash that provides for secure authorization information that can safely be used for object transfers.</description>
