    <title>"NETCONF Server and RESTCONF Server Configuration Models", Kent Watsen, Juergen Schoenwaelder</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-netconf-server-model-09.txt</link>
    <description>This draft defines a NETCONF server configuration data model and a RESTCONF server configuration data model.  These data models enable configuration of the NETCONF and RESTCONF services themselves, including which transports are supported, what ports the servers listen on, call-home parameters, client authentication, and related parameters.
