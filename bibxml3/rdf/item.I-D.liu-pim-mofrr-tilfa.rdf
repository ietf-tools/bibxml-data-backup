        <description>Multicast-only Fast Reroute (MoFRR) has been defined in [RFC7431], but the selection of the secondary multicast next hop only according to the loop-free alternate fast reroute, which has restrictions in multicast deployments. This document describes a mechanism for Multicast-only Fast Reroute by using Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate fast reroute, which is independent of network topology and can achieve covering more network environments.</description>
