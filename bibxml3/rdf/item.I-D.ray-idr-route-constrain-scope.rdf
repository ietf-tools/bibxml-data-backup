    <description>The Route Constrain address family can be used by a BGP speaker to signal a neighbor its interest in receiving only the routes with a matching route target (RT) extended community.  This signaling is afi-safi agnostic; the sender of a route constrain NLRI with an RT expresses its interest in receiving routes with that RT for all afi- safi.  The ability to further scope a given RT to a list of afi-safi would simplify network operations; then optimal route filtering would no longer require that the set of RTs used for different afi-safi be disjoint.  This document proposes a simple extended community based backward compatible method to associate the list of afi-safi of interest to a route constrain NLRI and discusses the operational procedure.</description>
