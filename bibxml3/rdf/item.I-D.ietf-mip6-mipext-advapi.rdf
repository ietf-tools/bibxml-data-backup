    <title>"Extension to Sockets API for Mobile IPv6", Samita Chakrabarti, Erik  Nordmark</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mip6-mipext-advapi-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes data structures and API support for Mobile IPv6 as an extension to the Advanced Socket API for IPv6. Just as the Advanced Sockets API for IPv6 gives access to various extension headers and the ICMPv6 protocol, this document specifies the same level of access for Mobile IPv6 components. It specifies a mechanism for applications to retrieve and set information for Mobility Header messages, Home Address destination options and Routing Header Type 2 extension headers. It also specifies the common data structures and definitions that might be used by certain advanced Mobile IPv6 socket applications.</description>
