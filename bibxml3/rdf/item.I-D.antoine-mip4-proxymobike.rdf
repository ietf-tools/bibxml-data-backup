    <title>"Mobility using Proxy MIP and Mobike", Stephane Antoine</title>

    <description>The simultaneous use of Mobike and Mobile IPv4 has been proposed to provide secure connectivity and session continuity to roaming corporate users.  Optimization of this solution have eliminated the tunneling overhead of Mobile IPv4 in the vpn tunnel by having a Foreign Agent co-located to the mobile vpn gateway.  This document further proposes an interaction between Mobike and Proxy Mobile IP that simplifies implementation and deployment of the previous methods.  The mobile vpn gateway is co-located to the Mobility Proxy Agent and each Access Point in the corporate network is equipped with Proxy Mobile IP.  When moving outside the corporate network, the Mobile Node secure connectivity and session continuity is handled by Mobike.  Proxy Mobile IP alone is used to handle mobility when the Mobile Node moves within the corporate network.  This document introduces an interaction between Internet Key Exchange v2 and Proxy Mobile IP in which the Internet Key Exchange AUTH request triggers the Proxy Mobile IP registration request to the internal Home Agent. This interaction easily allows the Mobile Node's home address to be used as vpn Tunnel Inner Address.</description>
