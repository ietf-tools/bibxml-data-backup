    <description>Content publishers (CPs) often use multiple Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to deliver content to consumers.  Though existing interactions between CPs and individual CDNs are beyond the scope of CDN interconnection (CDNI), it is important to understand the management capabilities and features available with existing non-interconnected multi-CDN deployments.  Before migrating to CDNI, CPs must first assess the suitability of CDNI as a replacement for their existing non-interconnected multi-CDN deployments.  CDN feature configuration and capability advertisement and enforcement is likely to occur through the CDNI metadata interface (MI).  This document describes an approach to implementing the CDNI MI through the use of an extensible metadata model and a light-weight HTTP-based API.</description>
