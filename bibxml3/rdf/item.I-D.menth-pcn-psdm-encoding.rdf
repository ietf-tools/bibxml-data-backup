    <title>"PCN Encoding for Packet-Specific Dual Marking (PSDM)", Michael Menth, Jozef  Babiarz, T Moncaster, Bob Briscoe</title>

    <description>This document proposes how PCN marks can be encoded into the IP header.  The presented encoding reuses the ECN field of the Voice- Admit DSCP in a single PCN domain.  The encoding of unmarked PCN packets indicates whether they are subject to either excess- or exhaustive-marking.  This is useful, e.g., when data and probe packets require different marking mechanisms.  Status  This memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually be published as an experimental RFC.</description>
