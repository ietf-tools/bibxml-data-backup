    <description>In some applications it may be necessary to send multiple media encodings corresponding to a media source with in independent RTP media streams.  This is called Simulcast.  This document discusses a framework for describing simulcast media streams in SDP and also defines semantics to express relationship amongst them.  The semantics defined in this document are to be used with the source specific grouping framework defined in the [RFC5576]</description>
