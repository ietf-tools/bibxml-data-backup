    <description>Mobile IP has been recently getting popularity with some interesting transformation in order to be more suitable for use by existing and emerging wireless technology, such as IEEE 802.16e Broadband Wireless Access(BWA) One of the fundamental features to make Mobile IP available in commercial world is secure access with it. In this draft, we propose a novel scheme to locally authenticate and authorize inter-domain roaming users for efficient way in IEEE 802.16e BWA based on authentication, authorization and accout-ing(AAA) infrastructure. We present the detailed operations to establish local security association(SA) for authentication and performance evaluation by con-sidering the traffic and mobility properties of a roaming user as well as the dis-tance between the mobile node(MN) and its home AAA server. Proposed scheme outperforms exiting method with respect to authentication cost and ser-vice latency.</description>
