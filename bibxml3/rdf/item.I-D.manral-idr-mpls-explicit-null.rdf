    <title>"Connecting IPv6 Islands over IPv4 MPLS networks using IPv6 Provider Edge  Routers (6PE-Alt)", Vishwas Manral</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-manral-idr-mpls-explicit-null-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides an alternate mechanism to [6PE] to interconnect IPv6 routes over MPLS-enabled IPv4clouds. This approach relies on IPv6 Provider Edge routers (6PE-Alt) which are Dual Stack in order to connect to IPv6 islands and to the MPLS core which is only required to run IPv4 MPLS and run the mechanism as described in this document.  The 6PE-Alt routers exchange the IPv6 reachability information transparently over the core using the Multi-Protocol Border Gateway Protocol (MP-BGP) over IPv4 or IPv6.  In doing so, the BGP Next Hop field is used to convey the IPv4 address of the 6PE-Alt router so that dynamically established IPv4-signaled MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) can be used without explicit tunnel configuration. Unlike [6PE] case the labels are not sent with each route and does not use BGP to transport labels [RFC3107]. It instead makes use of the IPv6 Explicit NULL label as the VPN label, which is defined [RFC3032] and updated in [RFC4182].  This document elegantly uses the concept of non overlapping IPv6 routes to provide BGP MPLS IP VPN functionality. The document can be further used for provinding the functionality in case of non-overlapping IPv6 routes.  This approach allows a functionality similar to [RFC4659], without the cumbursome extensions required for the same. With the [RFC3879] IPv6 addresses are now globally unique (except for Link local). It also reduces the number of multi AS scenarios.</description>
