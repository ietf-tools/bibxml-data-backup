    <description>Multiple enterprises (tenants) consuming resources in a public Cloud shares the physical infrastructure of one or more DCs out of which the Cloud resources are serviced.  Hence one of the major features that has to be supported in public Cloud DCs is multitenant isolation, which is realized via various DC isolation technologies, such as VLAN or VxLAN.  In a hybrid Cloud environment where a public Cloud (more specifically off-premises public Cloud resources acquired by a tenant ) becomes an _extension_ of a tenant intranet or private Cloud, the multitenant isolation capability has to be extended beyond the public Cloud DCs.  The multitenant isolation _domain_ has to span end-to-end from the tenant network or on-premises resources via the MAN/WAN and the public Cloud DC networks to tenant off-premises resources.  While multitenant isolationI isolates one tenant from another (inter-hybrid Cloud isolation), an enterprise may desire controlled connectivity to a hybrid Cloud from another Cloud or network or tenant or select resources.  In addition, there may be need for controlling direct reachability of resources within a hybrid Cloud itself (intra-hybrid Cloud).  The tenant network may be connected to the public Cloud (DCs) over the Internet or a private IP/MPLS MAN/WAN owned or operated by a service provider, which also may support PPVPN (Provider Provided VPN) service, such as the L3 MPLS VPN.  In this work we consider the latter type of network and describe a framework for supporting inter-hybrid Cloud multitenant isolation, inter-hybrid Cloud connectivity and intra-hybrid Cloud reachability.</description>
