    <title>"Multi-Session and Multi-Source Transmission in the Real-Time Transport  Protocol (RTP)", Thomas Schierl, Jonathan Lennox</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schierl-avt-rtp-multi-session-transmission-00.txt</link>
    <description>In this draft, we discuss problems related to multi-session and multi-source transmission using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP).  Most of the input to this draft is taken from email discussion.  Multi-session and multi-source transmission is motivated by media data which allows for different transport layer treatment of parts of the media.  This is typically the case for layered media. Multi-session transmission is when media data from a single media source is split over multiple RTP sessions.  Single-session multi- source transmission (from now on just called "multi-source transmission") is when data from a single media source is sent as several RTP streams in the same RTP session.  The main problems discussed are the mechanisms used for data alignment and source correlation.  This draft gives further an overview of payload formats using multi-sessions/multi-source transmission and highlights other transport related issues.  The draft concludes with recommendations for the discussed problems.</description>
