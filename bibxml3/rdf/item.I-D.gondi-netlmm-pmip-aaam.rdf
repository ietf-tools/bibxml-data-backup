    <description>Mobility access through IPv4 and IPv6 provides seamless services for the user terminals across different access networks. To provide seamless continuity while the mobile is moving from one access networks to another is provided by different mechanisms, on the whole the proposed mechanisms provides mobility with special requirements access mechanism. The foremost popular of the mobility mechanisms is provided by Charles Perkins in mobile IPv4 IETF RFC 2002. There are some of the issues that MIP doesn't provide as a total mobility solution. The Proxy MIP is a mobility mechanism to ensure mobility management of the user terminal in different access networks. This method provides the network based mobility management without any client interactions. By this method the signaling overhead and the latency during the handover and roaming is reduced. In this proposed mechanism the mobile node doesn't need to have support for the mobility instead the access network provide the mobility for the user terminal.  Even though the proxy mobile IPv4 provides the mobility management there are some of the issues that have to be solved for the network controlled mobility management. In this proposed draft we proposed new mechanism using proxy mobile IP with the mobility extensions provided by the AAA server at the time of authentication and authorizing a user terminal. Later in the draft we discuss the novel architecture and packet format for PMIP interactions with AAA of the access networks.</description>
