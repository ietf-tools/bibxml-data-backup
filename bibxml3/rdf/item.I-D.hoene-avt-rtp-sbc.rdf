    <title>"RTP Payload Format for Bluetooth's SBC audio codec", Christian Hoene, Frans Bont</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hoene-avt-rtp-sbc-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document specifies a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format to be used for the low complexity subband codec (SBC), which is the mandatory audio codec of the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) Specification written by the Bluetooth(r) Special Interest Group (SIG). The payload format is designed to be able to interoperate with existing Bluetooth A2DP devices, to provide high streaming audio quality, interactive audio transmission over the internet, and ultra-low delay coding for jam sessions on the internet. This document contains also a media type registration which specifies the use of the RTP payload format.</description>
