    <description>This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models in a comprehensive structure that may be used to configure and operate network devices.  The structure is itself represented as a YANG model, with all of the related component models logically organized in a way that is operationally intuitive, but this model is not expected to be implemented.  The identified component modules are expected to be defined and implemented on common network devices.  This document is derived from work submitted to the IETF by members of the informal OpenConfig working group of network operators and is a product of the Routing Area YANG Architecture design team.</description>
