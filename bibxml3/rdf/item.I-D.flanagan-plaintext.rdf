    <title>"Requirements for Plain-Text RFCs", Heather Flanagan</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-flanagan-plaintext-09.txt</link>
    <description>In 2013, after a great deal of community discussion, the decision was made to shift from the plain-text, ASCII-only canonical format for RFCs to XML as the canonical format.  The high-level requirements that informed this change were defined in RFC6949, "RFC Series Format Requirements and Future Development."  Plain text is still an important format for many in the IETF community, and will still be one of the publication formats rendered from the XML.  This draft documents the rendering requirements for the plain-text RFC publication format.  These requirements do not apply to plain-text RFCs published before the format transition.</description>
