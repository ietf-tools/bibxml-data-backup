    <description>When a client requests a time-shift service for a multicast session using RTP for media transport, like pause, instant replay, slow- motion video, frame-by-frame viewing, rewind, fast-forward, etc., it needs to switch from multicast session to unicast session.  This unicast session will always serve for the time-shift service unless the client manually switches back to the multicast session.  Actually a time- shift request may happens for all clients.  That is, multicast session stream will be replaced by many unicast time-shift streams having significant impact on network bandwidth usage.  In this document, we describe a method using existing RTP and RTCP protocol infrastructure that switches back to multicast session from unicast session of time-shift.  In this method, a burst RTP flow which is a little faster than the primary multicast rate may be transmitted so that unicast session may catch up and switch back to multicast session.</description>
