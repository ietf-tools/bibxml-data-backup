    <title>"A Framework for Conferencing with the Session Initiation Protocol", Jonathan  Rosenberg</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-sipping-conferencing-framework-05.txt</link>
    <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation, modification, and termination of media sessions between user agents. These sessions are managed by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIP relationship between a pair of user agents. Because dialogs are between pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-party communications (such as a phone call), is obvious. Communications sessions with multiple participants, generally known as conferencing, are more complicated. This document defines a framework for how such conferencing can occur. This framework describes the overall architecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for multi- party conferencing.</description>
