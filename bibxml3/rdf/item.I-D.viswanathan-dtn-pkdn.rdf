    <title>"Architecture for a Delay-and-Disruption Tolerant Public-Key Distribution Network (PKDN)", Kapali Viswanathan, Fred Templin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-viswanathan-dtn-pkdn-00.txt</link>
    <description>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model in which communications can be subject to long delays and/or intermittent connectivity.  DTN specifies the use of public-key cryptography to secure the confidentiality and integrity of messages in transit.  The use of public-key cryptography posits the need for certification of public keys and revocation of certificates.  This document formally defines the DTN key management problem and then provides a high-level design solution for delay and disruption tolerant distribution and revocation of public-key certificates along with relevant design options and recommendations for design choices.</description>
