    <title>"Signaling Trust Anchor Knowledge in DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)", Duane Wessels, Warren Kumari, Paul Hoffman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dnsop-edns-key-tag-05.txt</link>
    <description>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures.  These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain-of-trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS.  This document specifies two different ways for validating resolvers to signal to a server which keys are referenced in their chain-of-trust.  The data from such signaling allow zone administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers in a DNSSEC-signed zone.</description>
