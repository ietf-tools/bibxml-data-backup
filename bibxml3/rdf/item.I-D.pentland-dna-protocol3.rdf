    <title>"Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6 Networks (DNAv6)", Brett Pentland</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-pentland-dna-protocol3-00.txt</link>
    <description>Efficient detection of network attachment in IPv6 needs the following two components: a method for the host to query routers on the link to identify the link (Link Identification) and a method for the routers on the link to consistently respond to such a query with minimal delay (Fast RA). Solving the link identification based strictly on RFC 2461 is difficult because of the flexibilities offered to routers in terms of prefixes advertised in a router advertisement (RA) message. Similarly, the random delay in responding to router solicitation messages imposed by RFC 2461 makes to it difficult to achieve fast RA. In this memo, an integrated solution is presented. Monitoring of prefixes by both hosts and routers is used to achieve link identification while router advertisements are sent rapidly in a deterministic order by combining router solicitation source addresses with hash-based router tokens.</description>
