    <title>"An Incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) for IPv6 Transition", Sheng Jiang, Dayong Guo</title>

    <description>Global IPv6 deployment was slower than originally expected in the last ten years. As IPv4 address exhaustion gets closer, the IPv4/IPv6 transition issues become more critical and complicated. Host-based transition mechanisms are not able to meet the requirements while most end users are not sufficiently expert to configure or maintain these transition mechanisms. Carrier Grade NAT with integrated transition mechanisms can simplify the operation of end users during the IPv4/IPv6 migration or coexistence period. This document proposes an incremental Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) solution for IPv6 transition. It can provide IPv6 access services for IPv6-enabled end hosts and IPv4 access services for IPv4 end hosts while remaining most of legacy IPv4 ISP networks unchanged. It is suitable for the initial stage of IPv4/IPv6 migration. Unlike CGN alone, it also supports and encourages transition towards dual-stack or IPv6-only ISP networks.</description>
