    <title>"DKIM Third-Party Authorization for Sender Signer Practices", Douglas Otis</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-otis-dkim-tpa-ssp-04.txt</link>
    <description>TPA-label is a DNS-based prefix mechanism for DKIM policy records as a means to authorize Third-Party domains.  This mechanism allows first-party domains to autonomously authorize a range of third-party domains in a scalable, individual DNS transaction.  This authorization extends the scope of DKIM policy assertions to supplant more difficult to administer mechanisms.  Alternatives for facilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate the coordination between two or more domains by setting up selector/key DNS records, DNS zone delegations, or the regular exchange of public/ private keys.  Checking DKIM policies may occur when a From header email-address is not within the domain of a valid DKIM signature.  When a Third-Party signature is found, TPA-labels offer an efficient means for email address domains to authorize specific third-party signing domains. The scope of the authorization may separately assert identity authentication for From and Sender and Resent-* headers for email- addresses within the authorizing domain.  Identity authentication can be asserted by the scope of the authorization, even when signed by a Third-Party domain.  In addition, the RFC2821.MailFrom domain can authorize domains for controlling DSNs.</description>
