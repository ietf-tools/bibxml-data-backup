    <title>"Identity Registry (idreg)", Chris Wendt</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-wendt-modern-identity-registry-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document will describe an approach for how a distributed identity registry model might look.  It will consider both public registry components of the data model necessary for routing calls from one globally routable identity to another.  It will also consider part of the private registry components a provider may need to manage associations with users or customers.  Other topics include provider associations, application or service association, and the ability to support multiple identities associated with a user/ subscriber (e.g. telephone number and e-mail identity).</description>
