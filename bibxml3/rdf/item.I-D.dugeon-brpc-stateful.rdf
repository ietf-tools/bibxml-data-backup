    <title>"A Backward Recursive PCE-initiated inter-domain LSP Setup", Olivier Dugeon, Julien Meuric</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-dugeon-brpc-stateful-00.txt</link>
    <description>The Path Computation Element (PCE) working group (WG) has produced a set of RFCs to standardize the behavior of the Path Computation Element as a tool to help MPLS-TE, GMPLS LSP tunnels and Segment Routing paths placement.  This also include the ability to compute inter-domain LSPs or Segment Routing path following a distributed or hierarchical approach.  In complement to the original stateless mode, a stateful mode has been added.  In particular, the new PCInitiate message allows a PCE to directly ask a PCC to setup an MPLS-TE, GMPLS LSP tunnels or a Segment Routing path.  However, once computed, the inter-domain LSPs or Segment Routing path are hard to setup in the underlying network.  Especially, in operational network, RSVP-TE signaling is not enable between BGP border routers.  But, such RSVP- TE signaling is mandatory to setup contiguous LSP tunnels or to stitch or nest independent LSP tunnels to form the end-to-end inter- domain LSP tunnels.  This draft propose to combine a Backward Recursive method with PCInitiate message to setup independent LSP tunnels per domain and stitch or nest the different LSP tunnels to setup end-to-end inter-domain LSP tunnels without the need of inter- domain signaling between BGP border routers.  A new Stitching Label definition and new LSP-TYPE code points are proposed for that purpose.</description>
