    <title>"The case for an informed path selection service", Damien Saucez, Benoit  Donnet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-bonaventure-informed-path-selection-00.txt</link>
    <description>With today's peer-to-peer applications, more and more content is available from multiple sources.  In tomorrow's Internet hosts will have multiple paths to reach one destination host with the deployment of dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 hosts, but also with new techniques such as shim6 or other locator/identifier mechanisms being discussed within the IRTF RRG.  All these hosts will need to rank paths in order to select the best paths to reach a given destination/content.  In this draft, we propose an informed path selection service that would be queried by hosts and would rank paths based on policies and performance metrics defined by the network operator to meet his traffic engineering objectives.  A companion document describes a protocol that implements this service.</description>
