    <title>"Advertising an IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop", Francois Le Faucheur, Eric  Rosen</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lefaucheur-idr-v4nlri-v6nh-01.txt</link>
    <description>MultiProtocol-BGP (MP-BGP) specifies that the set of Network Layer protocols to which the address carried in the Next Hop field may belong is determined by the Address Family Identifier (AFI) and the Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI). The current AFI/SAFI definitions for the IPv4 address family only have provisions for advertising a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv4 protocol when advertising an IPv4 Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) or a VPN-IPv4 NLRI. This document specifies the extensions necessary to allow advertising an IPv4 NLRI or a VPN-IPv4 NLRI with a Next Hop address that belongs to the IPv6 protocol. This comprises an extension of the AFI/SAFI definitions to allow the address of the Next Hop for an IPv4 NLRI or VPN-IPv4 NLRI to also belong to the IPv6 protocol, the encoding of the Next Hop in order to determine which of the protocols the address actually belongs to, and a new BGP Capability allowing MP-BGP Peers to dynamically discover whether they can exchange IPv4 NLRI and VPN-IPv4 NLRI with an IPv6 Next Hop.</description>
