    <title>"Forward Error Correction (FEC) Framework", Mark Watson</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-watson-fecframe-framework-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides an initial proposal for a framework for using forward error correction (FEC) codes with applications in the Internet to provide protection against packet loss. The framework supports applying Forward Error Correction to arbitrary packet flows and is primarily intended for streaming media. This framework can be used to define Content Delivery Protocols that provide Forward Error Correction for streaming media delivery or other packet flows. Content Delivery Protocols defined using this framework can support any FEC Scheme (and associated FEC codes) which is compliant with various requirements defined in this document. Thus, Content Delivery Protocols can be defined which are not specific to a particular FEC Scheme and FEC Schemes can be defined which are not specific to a particular Content Delivery Protocol.</description>
