    <title>"HTTPS Token Binding with TLS Terminating Reverse Proxies", Brian Campbell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tokbind-ttrp-09.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines HTTP header fields that enable a TLS terminating reverse proxy to convey information to a backend server about the validated Token Binding Message received from a client, which enables that backend server to bind, or verify the binding of, cookies and other security tokens to the client's Token Binding key. This facilitates the reverse proxy and backend server functioning together as though they are a single logical server side deployment of HTTPS Token Binding.</description>
