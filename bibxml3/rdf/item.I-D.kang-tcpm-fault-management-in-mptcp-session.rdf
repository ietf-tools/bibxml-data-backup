    <title>"Fault Management Mechanism in MPTCP Session", Jiao Kang, liangqiandeng</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kang-tcpm-fault-management-in-mptcp-session-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document presents a mechanism for fault management during a MPTCP session.  It is used to convey subflow failure information from client to server by other subflow running normally.  It includes: 1) a new Fault Announce Option for describing subflow failure, 2) implementation and interoperability of this option during a MPTCP session when one subflow suffers a failure.  In fact, the server is able to determine network problems accurately based on these fault information reported from multiple clients for their connections.</description>
