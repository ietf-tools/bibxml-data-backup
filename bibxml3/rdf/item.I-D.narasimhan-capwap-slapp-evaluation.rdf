    <description>The CAPWAP Working Group (WG) is currently looking into defining a protocol that would enable interoperability in an IEEE 802.11 based wireless local area network (WLAN) comprised of Wireless Termination Points (WTP) and Access Controllers (AC) belonging to different vendors. This document presents a self-review of Simple Light Access Point Protocol (SLAPP), one of the candidate protocol proposals submitted to the CAPWAP WG for consideration as a CAPWAP protocol. The WG has requested that the authors of all candidate proposals to provide a document which evaluates how their submission meets the objectives, taxonomy, and problem statement.</description>
