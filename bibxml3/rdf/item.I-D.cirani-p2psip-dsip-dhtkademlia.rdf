    <title>"A Kademlia-based DHT for Resource Lookup in P2PSIP", Simone Cirani, Luca  Veltri</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-cirani-p2psip-dsip-dhtkademlia-00.txt</link>
    <description>This draft describes a Kademlia-based protocol for Resource Lookup in P2PSIP.  The proposed protocol is based on dSIP, a SIP-based protocol proposed by other authors as generic framework for a distributed SIP Location Service.  Although the dSIP authors have obsoleted the draft by a newer approach based on a binary protocol named RELOAD, we are still considering this SIP-based approach, due to implementation simplicity, possibility of reuse of already available SIP stack implementations, easy integration into existing UAs, minimization of the number of required protocols for a P2P UA, and widespread support for (and relative maturity of) the SIP standard.</description>
