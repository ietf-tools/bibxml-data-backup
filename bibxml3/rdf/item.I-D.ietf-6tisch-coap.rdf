    <title>"6TiSCH Resource Management and Interaction using CoAP", Raghuram Sudhaakar, Pouria Zand</title>

    <description>The [IEEE802154e] standardizes the TSCH mode of operation and defines the mechanisms for layer 2 communication between conforming devices. 6top defines a set of commands to monitor and manage the TSCH schedule.  To realize the full functionality of sensor networks and allow their adoption and use in real applications we need additional mechanisms.  Specifically, the interaction with 6top, control and modify schedules, monitor parameters etc must be defined.  Higher layers monitoring and management entities are then able to use these capabilities to create feedback loops.  Although, there have been many custom implementations of such feedback loops between the routing, transport and MAC layers in sensor network deployments, there has been a lack of standards based approaches.  This draft defines the messaging between monitoring and management entities and the 6top layer and a mapping to the 6top commands.  The document also presents a particular implementation of the generic data model specified in [I-D.ietf-6tisch-6top-interface] based on CoAP and CBOR.</description>
