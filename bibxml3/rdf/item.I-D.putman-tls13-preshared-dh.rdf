    <title>"Authenticated Key Agreement using Pre-Shared Asymmetric Keypairs for (Datagram) Transport Layer Security ((D)TLS) Protocol version 1.3", Tony Putman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-putman-tls13-preshared-dh-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document defines an authenticated key agreement method for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3.  The authentication method requires that the server (and optionally client) is pre-provisioned with a unique long-term static asymmetric Finite Field Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) keypair; the peer must be able to obtain the public key of the endpoint via an out-of-band mechanism (e.g. pre-provisioning).  The handshake provides ephemeral (EC)DH keys, and a common key schedule is agreed using Double- or Triple-(EC)DH.  Confirmation of knowledge of the key schedule provides server (and optionally client) authentication.</description>
