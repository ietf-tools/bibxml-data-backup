    <description>Latency is such requirement that must be achieved according to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service providers.  Network Performance Objective (NPO) defined in ITU-T Y.1540 and Y.1541 is used for describing the meaning and numerical values performance parameters traversing multiple packet networks. The definitions of the packet network performance parameters are often also used as the basis of SLAs service providers, but possibly with different numerical values.  A SLA is a part of a service contract where the level of service is formally defined between service providers and customers.  For example, the service level includes platinum, golden, silver and bronze.  Different service level may associate with different protection/restoration requirement.  Latency can also be associated with different service level.  The user may select a private line provider based on the ability to meet a latency SLA.  The key driver for latency is stock/commodity trading applications that use data base mirroring.  A few milli seconds can impact a transaction.  Financial or trading companies are very focused on end- to-end private pipe line latency optimizations that improve things 2-3 ms.  Latency and latency SLA is one of the key parameters that these "high value" customers use to select a private pipe line provider.  Other key applications like video gaming, conferencing and storage area networks require stringent latency and bandwidth.  This document describes the requirements and mechanisms to communicate latency as a traffic engineering performance metric in today's network which is consisting of potentially multiple layers of packet transport network and optical transport network in order to meet the latency SLA between service provider and his customers. This document also extends RSVP-TE and IGP to support these requirement.  These extensions are intended to advertise and convey the latency information of nodes and links as traffic engineering performance metric.</description>
