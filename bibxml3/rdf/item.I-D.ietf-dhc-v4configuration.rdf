    <title>"Provisioning IPv4 Configuration Over IPv6 Only Networks", Branimir Rajtar, Ian Farrer</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dhc-v4configuration-06.txt</link>
    <description>As IPv6 becomes more widely adopted, some service providers are choosing to deploy IPv6 only networks without dual-stack functionality for IPv4.  However, as access to IPv4 based services will continue to be a requirement for the foreseeable future, IPv4 over IPv6 mechanisms, such as softwire tunnels are being developed.  In order to provision end-user's hosts with the IPv4 configuration necessary for such mechanisms, a number of different approaches have been proposed.  This memo discusses each of the proposals, identifies the benefits and drawbacks and recommends approaches to be used as the basis for future deployment and development.</description>
