    <description>As communication devices become more hybrid, smart devices include more media-rich communication applications, and the boundaries between telecommunication and other applications becomes less clear. Simultaneously, as the end-devices become more mobile, application traffic transits more often between enterprise networks, the Internet, and cellular telecommunication networks, sometimes using simultaneously more than one path and network type.  In this context, it is crucial that quality of service be aligned between these different environments.  However, this is not always the case by default, and cellular communication networks use a different QoS nomenclature from the Internet and enterprise networks.  This document specifies a set of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Quality of Service (QoS) Class Identifiers (QCI) and 5G QoS Identifiers (5QI) to Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) mappings, to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by the 3GPP with the recommendations offered by the IETF, so as to maintain a consistent QoS treatment between cellular networks and the Internet.  This mapping can be used by enterprises or implementers expecting traffic to flow through both types of network, and wishing to align the QoS treatment applied to one network under their control with the QoS treatment applied to the other network.</description>
