    <title>"IETF Expectations of Participation in Development and Review of ITU-T Recommendations on MPLS-TP", Adrian Farrel, Stewart Bryant</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-farrel-mpls-tp-recommendation-review-01.txt</link>
    <description>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) in cooperation between the IETF and the ITU-T is documented in RFC 5317 as the report of the Joint Working Team on MPLS-TP. As part of this development process, the International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication Standardisation Sector (ITU-T) will develop a number of Recommendations. Those Recomendations will allow MPLS-TP to be integrated with current transport equipment and networks, including, in agreement with the IETF, the definition of any ITU-T-specific functionality within the MPLS-TP architecture via the Change Process for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Protocols and Procedures.  This document sets out the IETF's expectations of how the IETF, through individual participation and through consensus decisions, will contribute to in the development, review, and approval of those Recommendations.  This document does not modify any existing ITU-T or IETF procedures, but shows how those procedures can be used to facilitate cooperation for the MPLS-TP project.</description>
