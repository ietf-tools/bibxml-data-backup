    <title>"Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Experimentation", David Black</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-black-tsvwg-ecn-experimentation-04.txt</link>
    <description>Multiple protocol experiments have been proposed that involve changes to Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) as specified in RFC 3168. This memo summarizes the proposed areas of experimentation to provide an overview to the Internet community and updates RFC 3168, a Proposed Standard RFC, to allow the experiments to proceed without requiring a standards process exception for each Experimental RFC to update RFC 3168.  Each experiment is still required to be documented in an Experimental RFC.  In addition, this memo makes related updates to the ECN specifications for RTP in RFC 6679 and to the ECN specifications for DCCP in RFC 4341, RFC 4342 and RFC 5622.  This memo also records the conclusion of the ECN Nonce experiment in RFC 3540, obsoletes RFC 3540 and reclassifies it as Historic to enable new experimental use of the ECT(1) codepoint.</description>
