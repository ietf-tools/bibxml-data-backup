    <description>Usually in FMIPv6, the MN will start the binding process with its home agent and the correspondent nodes after it has attached to NAR. Till the binding is completed, the mobile node continues to receive packets via a reverse tunnel established between PAR and NAR. The duration of this tunnel will depend on the time it takes for the mobile node to complete its binding, till which time the tunnel will  continue to consume buffer and processing resources related to maintaining the tunnel and forwarding packets through this tunnel in both PAR and NAR.  This document specifies an extension to FMIPv6 to enhance its performance, in terms of resource management, by reducing the duration of the tunnel existence. This is achieved by enabling the NAR to act as a proxy for the MN for FMIPv6 handover. Additional message(s) and message options along with modifications to existing FMIPv6 messages and message options and definitions of new messages and message options to achieve the desired functionality is also described in this document.</description>
