    <title>"An IPvFuture Syntax for IPv6 Link-Local Addresses", Michael Sweet</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-sweet-uri-zoneid-01.pdf</link>
    <description>This document describes how the zone identifier of an IPv6 scoped address, defined as &lt;zone_id> in the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture (RFC 4007), can be represented in a literal IPv6 address and in a Uniform Resource Identifier that includes such a literal address.  It documents a long-standing usage of the IPvFuture extension point provided in the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) syntax specification [RFC3986].  [ Editor's note: This draft documents the IPvFuture format originally defined in [LITERAL-ZONE] and used by CUPS since 2005.  A separate, incompatible format was defined and published in RFC 6874. ]</description>
