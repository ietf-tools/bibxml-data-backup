    <title>"Extended DHCPv6 for Piggybacking Security Association Configuration", Di Ma</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-madi-dhc-dhcpv6-psac-00.txt</link>
    <description>IPSec [RFC2401]is pervasive in many scenarios to build the channel of security mechanism to protect the communication between the host and the local servers, such as DNS recursive name server [RFC1304].  In the public wireless access environment, an extra trust relationship configuration between the roaming host and the local server, manually or by IKE [RFC2409], is indispensible.  DHCP is typically the first protocol executed by a mobile host when it enters a new network, so this document present an extension to DHCPv6 to piggyback the parameters needed for IPSec, avoiding the delay invited by manual configuration of security association or IKE interaction for IPSec.</description>
