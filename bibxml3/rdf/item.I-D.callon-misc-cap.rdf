    <description>The Framework for Operational Security Capabilities [11] outlines the proposed effort of the IETF OPSEC working group. This includes producing a series of drafts to codify knowledge gained through operational experience about feature sets that are needed to securely deploy and operate managed network elements providing transit services at the data link and IP layers. Current plans include separate capabilities documents for Packet Filtering; Event Logging; In-Band and Out-of-Band Management; Configuration and Management Interfaces; AAA; and Documentation and Assurance. This document describes some additional miscellaneous capabilities which do not fit into any of these specific catagories, and whose descriptions are brief enough that it does not seem appropriate to create a separate document for each. Operational Security Current Practices [12] lists current operator practices related to securing networks. This document lists miscellaneous capabilities needed to support those practices. Capabilities are defined without reference to specific technologies. This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that implement the capability. Each capability cites the practices it supports. Current implementations that support the capability may be cited. Special considerations are discussed as appropriate listing operational and resource constraints, limitations of current implementations, tradeoffs, etc.</description>
