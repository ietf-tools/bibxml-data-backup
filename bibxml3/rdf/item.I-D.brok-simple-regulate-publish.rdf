    <description>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event State Publication describes a mechanism for a User Agent Client (UAC) to publish event state information to a User Agent Server (UAS). Generally, the UAC is free to monitor certain resources at a certain rate and publish changes of their event state, for instance with the presence event package. However, for a UAC on a mobile device, this can be very costly in terms of battery, computing, and network resources. Although some mechnisms exist for a UAC to deduce whether event state publication is needed and at what rate publish messages may be sent, these are rather coarse and reactive in nature. This memo defines a solution for a UAS to regulate monitoring and publications by providing detailed information to the UAC regarding which resources to monitor, at what rate, whether urgent and with what delta.</description>
