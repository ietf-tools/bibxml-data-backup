    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-miao-mip6-ft-02.txt</link>
    <description>As important security devices, firewalls are widely deployed in ISP and enterprise networks. However, currently firewalls, which are essentially designed for fixed networks, are difficult to support Mobile IPv6. Unless firewalls are aware of the detail of mobile IPv6 protocol, they impacts smooth operation of the protocol and can be harmful to mobile IPv6 deployment. This internet draft intends to show some ideas to solve the problems on mobile IPv6 firewall traversal. The solutions proposed are not an overall solution to fix all the traversal problems.</description>
