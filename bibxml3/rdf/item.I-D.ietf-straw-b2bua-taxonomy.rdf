    <description>In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path between the originating and final terminating endpoints, which go beyond the definition of a SIP Proxy, performing functions not defined in standards-track RFCs.  The only term for such devices provided in [RFC3261] is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which is defined as the logical concatenation of a SIP User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client (UAC).  There are numerous types of SIP Back-to-Back User Agents, performing different roles in different ways.  For Example IP-PBXs, Session Border Controllers (SBC) [RFC5853] and Application Servers (AS). This document identifies several common Back-to-Back User Agent roles, in order to provide taxonomy other documents can use and reference.</description>
