    <title>"Routing extensions for discovery of Multiprotocol (MPLS) Label Switch Router  (LSR) Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh membership", JP Vasseur</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-ccamp-automesh-04.txt</link>
    <description>The set up of a full mesh of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSP) among a set of Label Switch Routers (LSR) is a common deployment scenario of MPLS Traffic Engineering either for bandwidth optimization, bandwidth guarantees or fast rerouting with MPLS Fast Reroute. Such deployment may require the configuration of potentially a large number of TE LSPs (on the order of the square of the number LSRs). This document specifies Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) so as to provide an automatic discovery of the set of LSRs members of a mesh in order to automate the creation of such mesh of TE LSPs.</description>
