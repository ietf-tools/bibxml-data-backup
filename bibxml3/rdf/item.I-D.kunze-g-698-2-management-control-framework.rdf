    <description>This document provides a framework that describes a solution space for the control and management of optical interfaces parameters according to the Black Link approach as specified by ITU-T [ITU G.698.2].  In particular, it examines topological elements and related network management processes to operate this construct.  This framework is scoped to address the Optical Channel (OCh)-layer covered by G.698.2.  The focus is on enabling the wavelength provisioning process in a black link approach irrespective on how it is triggered i.e. by EMS, NMS or GMPLS.  This document covers management as well as control plane considerations in different management cases of a single channel DWDM interface as defined by ITU-G.698.2.  The purpose is to identify the necessary information elements and processes to be used by control or management devices for further processing.  Hence wavelength routing and selection processes as defined e.g. in WSON are beyond the scope of this document.</description>
