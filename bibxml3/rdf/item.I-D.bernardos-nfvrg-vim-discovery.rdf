    <description>Virtualized resources do not need to be limited to those available in traditional data centers, where the infrastructure is stable, static, typically homogeneous and managed by a single admin entity. Computational capabilities are becoming more and more ubiquitous, with terminal devices getting extremely powerful, as well as other types of devices that are close to the end users at the edge (e.g., vehicular onboard devices for infotainment, micro data centers deployed at the edge, etc.).  It is envisioned that these devices would be able to offer storage, computing and networking resources to nearby network infrastructure, devices and things (the fog paradigm). These resources can be used to host functions, for example to offload/complement other resources available at traditional data centers, but also to reduce the end-to-end latency or to provide access to specialized information (e.g., context available at the edge) or hardware.  This document describes mechanisms allowing dynamic discovery of virtualization resources and orchestrators in IPv6-based networks. New IPv6 neighbor discovery options are defined.</description>
