    <title>"A Framework of Media-Independent Pre-Authentication (MPA) for Inter-domain  Handover Optimization", Yoshihiro Ohba</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ohba-mobopts-mpa-framework-05.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a framework of Media-independent Pre- Authentication (MPA), a new handover optimization mechanism that addresses the issues on existing mobility management protocols and mobility optimization mechanisms to support inter-domain handover. MPA is a mobile-assisted, secure handover optimization scheme that works over any link-layer and with any mobility management protocol and is best applicable to support optimization during inter-domain handover. MPA's pre-authentication, pre-configuration, and proactive handover techniques allow many of the handoff related operations to take place before the mobile has moved to the new network. We describe the details of all the associated techniques and its applicability for different scenarios involving various mobility protocols during inter-domain handover.</description>
