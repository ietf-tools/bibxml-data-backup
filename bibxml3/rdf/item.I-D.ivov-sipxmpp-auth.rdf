    <title>"Problem Statement and Possible Best Practices for Authentication of SIP+ XMPP Clients", Emil Ivov, Enrico Marocco</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ivov-sipxmpp-auth-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document discusses several mechanisms for simplifying authentication of dual-stack SIP+XMPP clients against the corresponding SIP and XMPP services.  The text is not attempt to define a complex credential sharing protocol but rather to determine and eventually encourage use of a simple mechanism that would allow service providers to host a SIP+XMPP solution appearing as a single service to their users.  In other words, the goal here is to agree on a set of recommendations that would encourage client developers to implement simple UIs that would only require users to provide an ID and a password when configuring their SIP+XMPP account for the first time (as opposed to having to do so separately for SIP and XMPP).</description>
