    <description>Data aggregation is a key energy saving functionality in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for both data gathering applications and event-based applications, since the communication cost is often the higher order of the computation cost.  Through data aggregation, we can reduce the scale of data while maintaining the correctness of data for a set of symmetric functions called divisible perfectly compressible (DPC) functions.  Also the achievable minimum data rate among all sensor nodes is limited for random WSNs if we insist data from ALL sensors should be collected.  Hence we use gathering efficiency to indicate the number of nodes whose data are gathered. It is intuitive that there exists a tradeoff between the aggregation throughput and gathering efficiency.  This document introduces adaptive data aggregation schemes for WSN to consider the tradeoffs between the aggregation throughput and gathering efficiency. Specifically, the adaptive data aggregation schemes includes two protocols, Single-Hop-Length (SHL) Scheme and Multiple-Hop-Length (MHL) Scheme, for different gathering efficiency requirements.</description>
