    <description>In certain network deployments, a single operator has multiple Autonomous Systems(AS) to facilitate ease of management.  A multiple AS network design could also be a result of network mergers and acquisitions.  In such scenarios, a centralized Inter-domain TE approach could provide most optimal allocation of resources and the most controlled path placement.  BGP-LS-EPE [I-D.ietf-idr-bgpls-segment-routing-epe] describes an extension to BGP Link State (BGP-LS) for the advertisement of BGP Peering Segments along with their BGP peering node and inter-AS link information, so that efficient BGP Egress Peer Engineering (EPE) policies and strategies can be computed based on Segment Routing.  This document describes extensions to the BGP-LS EPE to enable it to be used for inter-AS Traffic-Engineering (TE) purposes.</description>
