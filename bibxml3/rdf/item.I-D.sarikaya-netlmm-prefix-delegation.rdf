    <title>"DHCPv6 Based Home Network Prefix Delegation for PMIPv6", Behcet Sarikaya, Frank Xia</title>

    <description>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, one prefix can only be assigned to one interface of a mobile node by the local mobility anchor (LMA) and different mobile nodes can not share this home network prefix. Managing per-MN's interface home network prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the LMA.  Based on the idea that Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers can manage prefixes, we propose a new technique in which LMA offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6 server. LMA requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node to the DHCPv6 server.  Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create a home address for its interface.  When the mobile station leaves the network, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers can also play a role in prefix delegation.</description>
