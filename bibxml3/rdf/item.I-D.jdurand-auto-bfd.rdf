    <title>"Path validation toward BGP next-hop with AUTO-BFD", Jerome Durand, David Freedman</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-jdurand-auto-bfd-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes a solution called AUTO-BFD, that automatically initiates BFD sessions for BGP next-hops.  This makes it possible to avoid blackholing scenarios when a BGP peer is not the BGP next-hop, especially on Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) when BGP Route-Servers are deployed.  When they are configured with this mechanism, routers can automatically try to establish a new adjacency for every new BGP next-hop.  BGP routes are then checked against the state of the BFD session for the corresponding next-hop.  Foreword  A placeholder to list general observations about this document.</description>
