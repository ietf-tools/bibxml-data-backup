    <description>This document defines a new ICMP Type for Captive Portal Messages. The ICMP Type will only be known to clients supporting this specification and provides both generic and flow 5-tuple specific notifications from the Captive Portal NAS.  Further, This document defines a multi-part ICMP extension to ICMP Destination Unreachable messages to signal, not only that the packet was dropped, but that it was dropped due to an Access Policy requiring Captive Portal interaction.  Legacy clients will only be processing the ICMP Destination Unreachable.  [ Editor note: The IETF is currently discussing improvements in captive portal interactions and user experience improvements.  See: https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/captive-portals ]  [RFC Editor: Please remove this before publication.
