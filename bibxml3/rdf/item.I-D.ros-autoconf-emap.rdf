    <title>"Extensible MANET Auto-configuration Protocol (EMAP)", Pedro Ruiz, Francisco  Ros</title>

    <description>Mobile Ad Hoc Networks need an auto-configuration protocol being able to satisfy their self-deployment requirements while remaining flexible enough to accommodate special features for different devices. The Extensible Manet Auto-configuration Protocol (EMAP) tries to fullfil these requirements both for IPv4 and IPv6 mobile ad hoc networks. It provides auto-configuration mechanisms for isolated as well as hybrid MANETs, and is envisioned to be integrated within unicast routing protocols (like DYMO [1] or OLSRv2 [2]). EMAP allows nodes to create a (highly likely) unique IP address which can be used locally inside the MANET. In a similar way, nodes can auto-configure globally routable IP addresses when one (or more) gateways to the Internet are present in the network. The general framework provided by the protocol may be used as a service discovery protocol for MANETs. As an example, this document also specifies an optional feature which consists on the discovery of DNS servers reachable from the MANET. However, the approach is extensible to other services like SIP proxies, authentication entities, etc. Therefore, EMAP has been designed taking into consideration the possibility of extending it later on with new features, uses, and optimizations.</description>
