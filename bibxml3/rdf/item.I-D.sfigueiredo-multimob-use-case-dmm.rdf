    <description>Mobile networks are changing towards distributed mobility management (DMM), tackling inefficiencies of existing mobility protocols regarding network management and packet routing. Identifying IP multicast use cases applicable to DMM is a logical step before exploring solution spaces. This document describes use cases where IP multicast is applied in DMM environments, considering two main deployment options: multicast router or MLD-Proxy deployment at a Mobility Access Router (MAR). Due to the lack of standard terminology, we refer to MAR as the entity embedding mobility-related functions, e.g. providing network access and flow anchoring capabilities. Each deployment option is thoroughly analyzed regarding its advantages and disadvantages, and both multicast listener and source mobility support are considered.</description>
