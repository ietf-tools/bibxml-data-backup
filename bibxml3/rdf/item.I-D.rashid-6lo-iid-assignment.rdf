    <description>In IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), randomizing the interface identifier (IID) is a common practice to promote privacy. If there are a very large number of nodes, as has been discussed in several use cases, the effect will to proportionately increase the number of IIDs.  A duplicate address detection (DAD) cycle is needed for each configured IID, introducing more and more overhead into the network.  Each failed DAD requires the initiating node to regenerate a new IID and undergo the DAD cycle again.  This document proposes an optimized approach when higher privacy is required in a given network by allowing a 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router) to provide a unique IID, avoiding any potential duplication.  Such practice also prevents failure of time-critical applications, by enabling 6LBR to provide a unique IID, in case of address collision.  Further improvements are proposed to enable multiple concurrent DAD cycles, and to return the randomized IID from 6LBR to 6LN in a space- efficient manner.</description>
