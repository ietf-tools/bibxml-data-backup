    <description>IPv4-over-IPv6 tunneling transition mechanisms provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co- existing period.  The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6(DHCPv6) options has been extended and defined to configure tunnel initiator (TI) in lightweight 4over6.  However, in many networks, the configuration information are stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through DHCPv6 protocol.  Thus AAA server as a database can be extended to establish and store the whole information of tunnels and help the tunnel concentrator (TC) recover in failure.  This document defines the mechanism and the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attributes that carry TI configuration information from AAA server to BNG and the tunnel configuration information from AAA server to TC.</description>
