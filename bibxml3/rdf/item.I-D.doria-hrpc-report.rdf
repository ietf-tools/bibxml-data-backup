It provides a framework while reporting on the study including: theoretical background, results and basic considerations.  It will reference the detailed work being done on terminlogy and case studies documented in the research draft.  It also folds in discussions from the research literature.

This draft is still in very early stages and welcomes further contribution.  Text is solicited.  Discussion on this draft at: hrpc@irtf.org // https://www.irtf.org/mailman/admindb/hrpc</description>
