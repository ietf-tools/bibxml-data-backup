    <description>This document defines an optional extension block, called a Retransmission Block (RB), that may be used with the Bundle Protocol [refs.DTNBP] within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [refs.DTNarch].  The Retransmission Block (RB) is designed to be used within a DTN that, as a matter of policy, deletes all replayed bundles from the network.  It is designed to be used in a network that permits duplicate bundles to be forwarded if those bundles have been retransmitted by a custodian, that may (if possible) permit duplicate bundles to be forwarded if those bundles are in intentional or unintentional routing loops (contingent on the availability of mechanisms to distinguish looping bundles from other bundles), but that will consider all other duplicate bundles to be maliciously replayed bundles and delete them as such.  The Retransmission Block is designed to be inserted into a bundle by a custodian when the custodian is retransmitting that bundle.  The purpose of the RB is to mark the bundle as a custody-based retransmission so that it can be distinguished from other types of duplicate bundles and thereby be spared from deletion.  This document defines the format and processing of this new Retransmission Block.</description>
