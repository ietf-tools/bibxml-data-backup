    <description>This document provides guidelines for achieving end to end Quality- of-Service (QoS) in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domain where the access network is based on IEEE 802.11.  RFC 7222 describes QoS negotiation between a Mobility Access Gateway (MAG) and Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a PMIPv6 mobility domain.  The negotiated QoS parameters can be used for QoS policing and marking of packets to enforce QoS differentiation on the path between the MAG and LMA. IEEE 802.11-2012, Wi-Fi Multimedia - Admission Control (WMM-AC) describes methods for QoS negotiation between a Wi-Fi Station (MN in PMIPv6 terminology) and an Access Point.  This document provides a mapping between the above two sets of QoS procedures and the associated QoS parameters.  This document is intended to be used as a companion document to RFC 7222 to enable implementation of end to end QoS.</description>
