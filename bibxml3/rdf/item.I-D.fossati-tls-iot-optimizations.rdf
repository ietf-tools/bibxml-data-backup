    <description>Internet protocols work well in a variety of environments, including Internet of Things (IoT) deployments.  While there are some optimization possibilities to reduce code size, bandwidth utilization, and to improve battery lifetime, in general most Internet protocols are also applicable to constrained environments. TLS and DTLS are two such security protocols that can be used by many IoT devices since DTLS/TLS provide lot of flexiblity in terms credential choice, ciphersuite usage, etc.  The DICE working group has developed a specification that profiles the use of TLS and DTLS for IoT environments, without changing the TLS/DTLS specifications.  This memo goes a step further and proposes changes to the DTLS/TLS protocol to introduce further optimizations.  Since the ongoing work on TLS/DTLS 1.3 already offers several improvements (compared to previous versions) this document focuses on the use of version 1.3 and suggests further optimizations.</description>
