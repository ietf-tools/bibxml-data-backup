    <description>This document describes translation between IGMP and MLD.  This allows single-stack multicast nodes to participate in multicast groups from a different address family.  Both sending and receiving is supported by this translation mechanism.  Both any-source and source-specific multicast (ASM and SSM) are supported as well.</description>
