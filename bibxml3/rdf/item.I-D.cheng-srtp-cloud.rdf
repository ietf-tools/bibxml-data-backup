    <title>"Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for Cloud Services", Yi Cheng, John Mattsson, Mats Naslund</title>

    <description>This document describes the use of end-to-end (inner) and hop-by-hop (outer) cryptographic transforms within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP).  The motivation is to support use cases when two or more end-points communicate via one (or more) cloud service (e.g. virtualized cloud-based conferencing) that are not trusted to access the media content.  One of the main aspects of the transform is to make the confidentiality and message authentication independent of the RTP header.  Another central aspect is to enable identification of the cryptographic context (keys etc.).  Besides the security of the end-points, also trust assumptions regarding the cloud services are addressed.</description>
