    <description>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile in cooperation between IETF and ITU-T does not fully define and document processes for development of the required RFCs.  This document complements the processes documented in the JWT decision with a few separate elements; it:  o  provides an adaptation of the IETF working group process,  o  identifies the expected participation in the process by the ITU-T,  o  clarifies the decision rules regarding MPLS-TP documents.  This document is not intended to specify any ITU-T process; to the extent necessary ITU-T activities will be done according to ITU-T process/rules.  Nor is this document is intended to specify the IETF working group process, it is limited to the temporary adaptations of that process that is the result of that IETF and ITU-T accepted the proposal in the JWT report to jointly develop the MPLS Transport Profile.  In general it may be said that these adaptations are introduced to ensure a good and consistent document review across the two organizations.</description>
