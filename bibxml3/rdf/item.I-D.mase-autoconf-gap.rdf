    <title>"Gateway Aggregation Protocol (GAP) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", Kenichi  Mase, Yasunori Owada</title>

    <description>We consider Internet connectivity of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), where two or more fixed or mobile nodes (MNs) may have a wired or wireless interface to the fixed Internet in addition to the wireless interface for the MANET. The points of attachment of MNs to the Internet are termed as "Access Routers (ARs)," A stationary MN, that has wired connection with the Internet may become an AR itself. Typically, only a single AR is used as the Internet Gateway (IGW) in a MANET. Two or more IGWs may be used, but the number of the IGWs should be kept to a minimim. This minimizing feature is named "Gateway Aggregation." MANET routing protocol runs on the MBGs, and both routing control messages and data packets of the MANET are tunneled between an MN and its associated AR, between an AR and its selected IGW, and also between an IGW and its peer IGW. The IGW advertises the network prefix for the MNs to configure their global care-of-addresses. An MN configures its care-of-address with the prefix advertised by one of the IGWs. Once it obtains its global address, it does not have to change it during its stay in the MANET.</description>
