    <description>ENUM possesses the feature of E.164 number authenticity, therefore by being carried with initiation signal of application services, ENUM number can be used to identify originer. The service initiation signal includes sender's (originer's) un- encrypted ENUM number and encrypted ENUM number, or some other information needed by specific applications, then receiver decrypts encrypted ENUM number and compares decrypted result with the un- encrypted ENUM number to authenticate the originer's identity.</description>
