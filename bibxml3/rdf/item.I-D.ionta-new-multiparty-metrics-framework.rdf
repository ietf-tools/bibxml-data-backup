    <title>"New Performance Metrics Composition Framework for Multiparty Services", Tiziano Ionta</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ionta-new-multiparty-metrics-framework-02.txt</link>
    <description>One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complex growth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs along the Core network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainly derived from a "Network-Oriented point of view", and therefore a general perspective, not focused on specific services - with some more Performance factors, so to include a "Service-Oriented point of view", more centred on the particular kind of service, with its own characteristics in terms of protocol, application, manageability, and so on. Almost nothing about this new approach has been standardized yet for the core network. To achieve the above goal, and starting from the one-to-group performance metrics outlined in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], a new metrics composition/aggregation framework is proposed in this memo, where the main focus is on multiparty communications (e.g. video providers, online biding, online stock market, etc.). Finally this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes, framework concepts, and need to widen the current performance metrics depending on the application, service etc.</description>
