    <title>"An Information Model for Basic Network Policy", Susan Hares, Wenson Wu</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-hares-i2rs-info-model-policy-03.pdf</link>
    <description>This document contains three information Models: Basic Network Policy (BNP IM), Policy-Based Routing (PBR), I2RS Local-Config (I2RS-LC IM). The I2RRS-LC IM provides both an I2RS store of Policies plus a store of Policy Templates.  The BNP IM has the following levels of Policy Hierarchy: Policy Set, Policy Group, Policy Rule, and conditional actions within the policy rule (conditional match and Action).  The PBR IM, I2RS LC IM, BGP Information Model (BGP IM), Service Topology Information Model (SF-Topo IM), and the Service Forwarding Chaining IM (SFC IM) utilize and extend the BNP IM.  This draft lists the extensions to the BNP IM that support these information models (PBR IM, I2RS LC IM, BGP IM, SSF-Topo IM and SFC-Policy IM).  The BNP IM is based on the concept of an extensible information model for representing policies.  This concept is also found in the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) (RFC3060) and the Quality of Service (QoS) Policy Information Model (QPIM)(RFC3644) and policy based routing.</description>
