    <description>When a connection request comes in a mesh optical network, the routers automatically choose the suitable routing paths and wavelength to it according to the network topology and link state information saved in its global link state database. Because some of these wavelengths may be released or occupied at any time, the global state database is always out of date and needed by update by some an update policy. A suitable link state update policy is critical, since that a high frequency update polity imposes heavy burden on network, while a low frequency one would increase the inaccurate of the global link state database. In this paper, we propose a link state update policy, named EA-HD policy, which considers two index of a link, one is the Hamming distance between the local link state database and the global link state database, and another is the used ratio of its wavelengths. The proposed update policy gets a trade-off between the accurate of link state information and its update cost. Simulation proves that our scheme achieve a good performance in traffic blocking probability while maintaining moderate volume of update traffic.</description>
