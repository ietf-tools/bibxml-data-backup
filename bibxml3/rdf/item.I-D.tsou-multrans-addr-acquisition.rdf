    <title>"Address Acquisition For Multicast Content When Source and Receiver Support Differing IP Versions", Tina Tsou</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tsou-multrans-addr-acquisition-00.txt</link>
    <description>In a typical IP television (IPTV) system, the receiver acquires information about available program content, the subscriber selects a program to watch, and the receiver signals to the network to begin receiving the program in the form of multicast content.  The program content information is typically XML-encoded, can be transmitted in multiple segments, possibly over multiple channels, but includes media stream descriptions for the individual program descriptions that may also be XML-encoded or may use the Session Description Protocol (SDP, RFC 4566).  The media stream descriptions provide multicast group and unicast source addresses that are used in the subsequent signalling to the network.  During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where the IP version supported by the receiver differs from that supported by the source.  This memo examines and evaluates alternative strategies for allowing the receiver to acquire addresses in such scenarios in the version it supports.</description>
