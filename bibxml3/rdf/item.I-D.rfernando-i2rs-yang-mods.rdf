    <description>Interface to Routing Systems (I2RS) provides the mechanisms for the programmatic access of routing system components. YANG [RFC 6020] is a modeling language that is used to specify an external visible data model of sub-system - for defining both configuration and operational data held in the networking device. NETCONF is the protocol that is used to perform these configurations and accessing the operational data.  This document proposes to use the YANG data modeling language for I2RS data models. It also proposes a set of YANG language changes to enable the I2RS data models for multi-client and programmatic access.  This document also proposes the scope for the I2RS programmed data set on the Routing System and the necessary mechanisms for data synchronization.  This document also recommends a binary encoding for "on-the-wire" transfer of the YANG data model elements instead of XML.</description>
