    <description>LRDD (pronounced 'lard') provides a process for obtaining information about a resource identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). The 'information about a resource' - a resource descriptor - provides machine-readable information that aims to increase interoperability and enhance interactions with the resource.  LRDD provides a narrow and well-defined set of rules for obtaining and processing link-based descriptors (found in multiple sources such as HTTP headers, document markup, and resource descriptors) which are often required for security and consistent client behavior.</description>
