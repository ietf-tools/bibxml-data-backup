    <description>According to RFC 7176, DRB on a link uses the Appointed Forwarders sub-TLV to inform other ISs on the link that they are the designated VLAN-x forwarder for one or more ranges of VLAN IDs. Appointed Forwarders sub-tlv has Appointed Information field which carries information about Appointee Nickname, Start.VLAN and End.VLAN. Both Start.VLAN and VLAN.end to the same value indicates a range of one VLAN ID, if they are different then the Appointed RBridge is AF for that range of VLAN ID's. If end-station's VLAN's are configured in discontiguous/discreet [1,3,5,7 etc] way then DRB has to send Appointed Information equal to number of Discreet VLAN's Appointed for a particular RBridge. The problem will worsen if huge number of endstation VLAN's are discreet. This paper is an attempt to handle such scenarios.</description>
