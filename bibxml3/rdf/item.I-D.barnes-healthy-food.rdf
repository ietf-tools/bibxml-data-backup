    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-barnes-healthy-food-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the basic requirements for food for folks that attend IETF meetings require special diets, as well as those that prefer to eat healthy.  While, the variety of special diets is quite broad, the most general categories are described.  There can be controversy as to what constitutes healthy eating, but there are some common, generally available foods that comprise the basis for healthy eating and special diets.  This document provides some recommendations to meeting planners, as well as participants, in handling these requirements.</description>
