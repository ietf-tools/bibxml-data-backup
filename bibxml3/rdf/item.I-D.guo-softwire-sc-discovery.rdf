    <title>"Softwire Concentrator Discovery Using DHCP", Dayong Guo, Sheng Jiang</title>

    <description>Several types of Carrier Grade NATs have been proposed to simplify IPv4/IPv6 transition of the edge network by integrating tunnels and NAT. A very common scenario is that many users set up softwires to a softwire concentrator for public or private access services. In order to establish softwires successfully, a new mechanism is required to enable users in the edge network to discover the information of the concentrator. This document describes how a host or Customer Premises Equipment discovers the remote softwire concentrator or CGN in a hub and spoke network using DHCP. Based on two new Softwire Concentrator Discovery DHCP Options, proposed in the document, a user can obtain the information of the softwire concentrator or CGN and then set up a tunnel to it.</description>
