    <title>"End-to-End Identity Important in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", John Elwell</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-elwell-sip-e2e-identity-important-03.txt</link>
    <description>This document surveys existing mechanisms in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for identifying and authenticating the source of a SIP request (or caller identification).  It describes how identification and authentication are not always end-to-end and the problems that this can lead to, particularly since media security based on techniques such as DTLS-SRTP is dependent on end-to-end authenticated identification of parties.  This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</description>
