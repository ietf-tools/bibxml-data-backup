    <description>Providing timing services over an IP network, known as wall-clock, has traditionally been done with the Network Time Protocol, NTP.  The current version of NTP, version 4, has been in existence for a long time, but only recently been adopted as an IETF Standard.  In the mean time however, the requirements for higher precision of wall- clock services over IP networks has grown.  This document outlines some of the requirements of wall-clock services that is not provided by NTPv4, and is intended to serve as a gap analysis.</description>
