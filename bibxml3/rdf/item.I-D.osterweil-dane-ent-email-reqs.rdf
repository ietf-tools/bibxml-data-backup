    <description>Individuals and organizations have expressed a wish to have the ability to send encrypted and/or digitally signed email end-to-end. One key obstacle to end-to-end email security is the difficulty in discovering, obtaining, and validating email credentials across administrative domains.  This document addresses foreseeable adoption obstacles for encrypted and digitally signed email in enterprises, and outlines requirements.  Some of the requirements below are not DANE specific, and all may not be solvable with a DANE solution, but are included for completeness and as an attempt to give a holistic view of enterprise email security requirements.</description>
