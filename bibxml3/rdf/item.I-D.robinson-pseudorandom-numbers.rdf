    <description>This document provides a set of several thousand standardized hexadecimal pseudorandom values for use in creating repeatable sequences of so-called "random" numbers for various purposes. It can also provide a set of seed values for encryption or compression programs or any other use of a large set of numbers. It also provides a reference listing for the MD5 and CRC values of all prior published on-line Internet RFCs. Distribution of this memo is unlimited and unrestricted. Reproduction of all or part of this document for any purpose is permitted, and without any requirement to secure permission or payment of royalty.</description>
