    <title>"SLAP quadrant selection option for DHCPv6", Carlos Bernardos, Alain Mourad</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-dhc-slap-quadrant-12.txt</link>
    <description>IEEE originally structured the 48-bit MAC address space in such a way that half of it was reserved for local use.  In 2017, IEEE published a new standard (IEEE Std 802c) with a new optional "Structured Local Address Plan" (SLAP).  It specifies different assignment approaches in four specified regions of the local MAC address space.  IEEE is developing protocols to assign addresses (IEEE P802.1CQ). There is work also in the IETF on specifying a new mechanism that extends DHCPv6 operation to handle the local MAC address assignments.  This document proposes extensions to DHCPv6 protocols to enable a DHCPv6 client or a DHCPv6 relay to indicate a preferred SLAP quadrant to the server, so that the server may allocate MAC addresses in the quadrant requested by the relay or client.  A new DHCPv6 option (QUAD) is defined for this purpose.</description>
