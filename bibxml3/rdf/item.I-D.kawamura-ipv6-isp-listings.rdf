    <title>"A Basic Guideline for Listing ISPs that Run IPv6", Seiichi Kawamura, Edward Jankiewicz</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-kawamura-ipv6-isp-listings-01.txt</link>
    <description>There are many web sites that list IPv6 enabled service providers, or attempt to categorize the IPv6 capability of ISPs.  While these opinions are helpful, there is no standard criteria used by the sites, so it is difficult to compare the results.  This document surveys current listings, and proposes a set of guidelines that could be taken into consideration by theses sites, or by anyone looking to evaluate an ISP's IPv6 capability.  This guideline can also be used as a checklist by ISPs planning activation of IPv6 in their network.</description>
