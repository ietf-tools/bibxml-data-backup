    <title>"Moving Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) IANA registries to a new registry", Loa Andersson, Carlos Pignataro</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-lcap-mpls-moving-iana-registries-02.txt</link>
    <description>RFC 5586 generalized the applicability of the pseudowire Associated Channel Header (PW-ACH) into the Generic Associated Channel G-Ach. However, registries and allocations of G-ACh parameters had been distributed throughout different, sometimes unrelated, registries. This document coalesces these into a new "Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)" registry under the "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)" heading.  This is an update to RFC 5586 [RFC5586].  This document also updates RFC 6374, RFC 6428, RFC 6378, RFC 6427, RFC-ietf-mpls-gach-adv-08, and RFC-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing-08.</description>
