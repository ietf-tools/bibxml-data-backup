    <title>"Transmission of IP Packets over Ethernet over IEEE 802.16", Maximilian  Riegel</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-riegel-16ng-ip-over-eth-over-80216-01.txt</link>
    <description>This document describes the behavior of the Ethernet emulation on top of IEEE 802.16 to efficiently support the transmission of IPv4 as well as IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.16 radio links. Due to resource constraints of radio transmission systems and the limitations of the IEEE 802.16 MAC layer for the emulation of Ethernet, the transmission of IP over an emulated LAN on top of IEEE 802.16 may considerably benefit by adding IP specific support functions within the Ethernet emulation on top of IEEE 802.16.</description>
