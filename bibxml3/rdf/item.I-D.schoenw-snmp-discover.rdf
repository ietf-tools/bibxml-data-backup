    <title>"Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) EngineID Discovery", Juergen  Schoenwaelder</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-schoenw-snmp-discover-02.txt</link>
    <description>The third version of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) assumes that a manager knows the identifier of a remote SNMP protocol engine (the so called snmpEngineID) in order to retrieve or manipulate objects maintained locally on the remote engine. This document introduces a well-known localEngineID and a discovery mechanism which can be used to learn the engine identifier of a remote SNMP protocol engine. The proposed mechanism is independent of the features provided by SNMP security models and may also be used by other protocol interfaces providing access to managed objects.</description>
