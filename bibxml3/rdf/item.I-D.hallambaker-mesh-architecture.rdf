        <description>The Mathematical Mesh is a Threshold Key Infrastructure that makes computers easier to use by making them more secure.  Application of threshold cryptography to key generation and use enables users to make use of public key cryptography across multiple devices with minimal impact on the user experience.  This document provides an overview of the Mesh data structures, protocols and examples of its use.  [Note to Readers] Discussion of this draft takes place on the MATHMESH mailing list (mathmesh@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search/?email_list=mathmesh.
