    <title>"IPv6 Path MTU Interactions With Link Adaptation", Fred Templin</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-templin-6man-linkadapt-02.txt</link>
    <description>IPv6 intentionally deprecates fragmentation by routers in the network.  Instead, links with restricting Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) must either drop each too-large packet and return an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (PTB) message or perform link-specific fragmentation and reassembly (also known as "link adaptation") at a layer below IPv6.  This latter category of links is often performance-challenged to accommodate steady-state link adaptation.  This document therefore proposes an update to the base IPv6 specification to better accommodate links that require link-specific adaptation.</description>
