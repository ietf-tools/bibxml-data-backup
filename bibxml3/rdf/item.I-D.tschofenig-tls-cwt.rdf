    <title>"Using CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs) in Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)", Hannes Tschofenig, Mathias Brossard</title>

    <description>The TLS protocol supports different credentials, including pre-shared keys, raw public keys, and X.509 certificates.  For use with public key cryptography developers have to decide between raw public keys, which require out-of-band agreement and full-fletched X.509 certificates.  For devices where the reduction of code size is important it is desirable to minimize the use of X.509-related libraries.  With the CBOR Web Token (CWT) a structure has been defined that allows CBOR-encoded claims to be protected with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE).  This document registers a new value to the "TLS Certificate Types" sub-registry to allow TLS and DTLS to use CWTs.  Conceptually, CWTs can be seen as a certificate format (when with public key cryptography) or a Kerberos ticket (when used with symmetric key cryptography).</description>
