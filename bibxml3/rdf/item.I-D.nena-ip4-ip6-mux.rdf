    <title>"Never Ending Network Addresses: IPv4 Multiplexing through IPv6", Alessandro  Spinella</title>

    <description>While the wide use of IPv4 "private" addresses [RFC1918] lead to a great flexibilty degree of uninterconnected networks and use of IPv6 offer a huge address space; no "nice" mechanism exist to hide overlap of existing IPv4 "private" networks if and when the sum of used address spaces is greater than the IPv4 "private" address space. This document specifies how to walk around the matter without any coordination, renumbering or IPv6 adoption by overlapping networks owners.</description>
