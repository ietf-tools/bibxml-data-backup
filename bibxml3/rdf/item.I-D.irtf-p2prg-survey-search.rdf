    <description>The pace of research on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking in the last five years warrants a critical survey. P2P has the makings of a disruptive technology - it can aggregate enormous storage and processing resources while minimizing entry and scaling costs. Failures are common amongst massive numbers of distributed peers, though the impact of individual failures may be less than in conventional architectures. Thus the key to realizing P2P's potential in applications other than casual file sharing is robustness. P2P search methods are first couched within an overall P2P taxonomy. P2P indexes for simple key lookup are assessed, including those based on Plaxton trees, rings, tori, butterflies, de Bruijn graphs and skip graphs. Similarly, P2P indexes for keyword lookup, information retrieval and data management are explored. Finally, early efforts to optimize range, multi-attribute, join and aggregation queries over P2P indexes are reviewed. Insofar as they are available in the primary literature, robustness mechanisms and metrics are highlighted throughout. However, the low-level mechanisms that most affect robustness are not well isolated in the literature. Recommendations are given for future research.</description>
