    <title>"Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Cause URI parameter for Service Number translation", Marianne Mohali, Mary Barnes</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mohali-dispatch-cause-for-service-number-14.txt</link>
    <description>RFC4458 (SIP URIs for applications) defines a "cause" URI parameter, which may appear in the Request-URI of a SIP request, that is used to indicate a reason why the request arrived to the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the message.  This document creates a new predefined value for the "cause" URI parameter to cover service number translation for cases of retargeting due to specific service action leading to the translation of a called service access number.  This document also provides guidance, which was missing in RFC4458, for using the "cause" URI parameter within the History-Info header field since this use is mandatory in some IP networks' implementations.  This document updates RFC4458.</description>
