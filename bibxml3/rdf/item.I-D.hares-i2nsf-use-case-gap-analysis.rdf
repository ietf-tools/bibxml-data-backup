    <description>This document provides a summary of the I2NSF use cases plus a summary of the stat of the art in industries and IETF work which is relevant to the Interface to Network Security Function (I2NSF).  The I2NSF focus is to define data models and interfaces in order to control and monitor the physical and virtual aspects of network security functions.  The use cases are organized in two basic scenarios.  In the access network scenario, mobile and residential users access NSF capabilities using their network service provider infrastructure.  In the data center scenario customers manage NSFs hosted in the data center infrastructure.</description>
