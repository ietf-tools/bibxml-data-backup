    <description>Server virtualization has been overwhelmingly accepted especially in cloud-based data centers. Accompanied with expansion of services and technology advancements, the size of a data center has increased significantly. There could be hundreds or thousands of physical servers installed in a single large data center which implies that the number of Virtual Machines (VMs) could be in the order of millions. Effectively supporting millions of VMs with limited hardware resources, becomes a real challenge to networking vendors. This document describes a method to scale a switching system with limited hardware resources using IPv6 in large data center environments.</description>
