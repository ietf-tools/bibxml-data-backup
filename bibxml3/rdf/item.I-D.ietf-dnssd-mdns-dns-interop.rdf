    <title>"On Interoperation of Labels Among Conventional DNS and Other Resolution Systems", Andrew Sullivan</title>

    <description>Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming systems other than the Domain Name System when looking for services. Moreover, when it uses the DNS, DNS-Based Service Discovery uses the full capability of DNS, rather than using a subset of available octets.  In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name systems and conventions for their operation are in use, it is important to attend to differences in the underlying technology and operational environment.  This memo presents an outline of the requirements for selection of labels for conventional DNS and other resolution systems when they are expected to interoperate in this manner.</description>
