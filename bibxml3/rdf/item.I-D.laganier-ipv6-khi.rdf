    <title>"An IPv6 Prefix for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers  (ORCHID)", Pekka Nikander</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-laganier-ipv6-khi-07.txt</link>
    <description>This document introduces Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers (ORCHID) as a new, experimental class of IPv6-address- like identifiers. These identifiers are intended to be used as end- point identifiers at applications and Application Programming Interfaces (API) and not as identifiers for network location at the IP layer, i.e., locators. They are designed to appear as application layer entities and at the existing IPv6 APIs, but they should not appear in actual IPv6 headers. To make them more like vanilla IPv6 addresses, they are expected to be routable at an overlay level. Consequently, while they are considered as non-routable addresses from the IPv6 layer point of view, all existing IPv6 applications are expected to be able to use them in a manner compatible with current IPv6 addresses. This document requests IANA to allocate a temporary prefix out of the IPv6 addressing space for Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Identifiers. By default, the prefix will be returned to IANA in 2027, continued use requiring IETF consensus.</description>
