    <title>"Exploiting External Event Detectors to Anticipate Resource Requirements for the Elastic Adaptation of SDN/NFV Systems", Pedro Martinez-Julia</title>

    <description>The adoption of SDN/NFV technologies by current computer and network system infrastructures is constantly increasing, becoming essential for the the particular case of edge/branch network systems.  The systems supported by these infrastructures require to be adapted to environment changes within a short period of time.  Thus, the complexity of new systems and the speed at which management and control operations must be performed go beyond human limits.  Thus, management systems must be automated.  However, in several situations current automation techniques are not enough to respond to requirement changes.  Here we propose to anticipate changes in the operation environments of SDN/NFV systems in response to external events and reflect it in the anticipation of the amount of resources required by those systems for their ulterior adaptaion.  The final objective is to avoid service degradation or disruption while keeping close-to-optimum resource allocation to reduce monetary and operative cost as much as possible.  Here we discuss how to achieve such capabilities by the integration of the Autonomic Resource Control Architecture (ARCA) to the management and operation (MANO) of NFV systems.  We showcase it by building a multi-domain SDN/NFV infrastructure based on OpenStack and deploying ARCA to adapt a virtual system based on the edge/branch network concept to the operational conditions of an emergency support service, which is rarely used but that cannot leave any user unattended.</description>
