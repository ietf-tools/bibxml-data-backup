    <description>This memo presents an RDF [refs.RDF] vocabulary for describing an application extension bundle [refs.aeb].  An application extension bundle, otherwise known as an add-on, extension, plug-in, suite, or package, is an encapsalation of all the data needed to add functionality to a plug-in based application.  An integral piece of an application extension bundle is the metadata describing the bundle.  The described RDF vocabulary contains required and optional metadata fields used by an application extension bundle to describe itself.</description>
