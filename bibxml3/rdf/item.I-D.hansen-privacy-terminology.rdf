    <title>"Privacy Terminology", Marit Hansen, Hannes Tschofenig, Rhys Smith</title>

    <description>Privacy is a concept that has been debated and argued throughout the last few millennia by all manner of people.  Its most striking feature is that nobody seems able to agree upon a precise definition of what it actually is.  In order to discuss privacy in any meaningful way a tightly defined context needs to be elucidated.  The specific context of privacy used within this document is that of "personal data", information about an individual stored and/or transmitted electronically in Internet protocols.  This context is highly relevant since a lot of work within the IETF involves defining protocols that can potentially transport (either explicitly or implicitly) personal data.  This document aims to establish a basic lexicon around privacy so that IETF contributors who wish to discuss privacy considerations within their work can do so using terminology consistent across the area.
