    <title>"An Analysis of Centrally Assigned Unique Local Addresses", Margaret  Wasserman</title>

    <description>There has been discussion within the IETF IPv6 community for some time regarding whether or not to define Centrally Assigned Unique Local Addresses (ULA-Cs).  Although many arguments both for and against the definition of ULA-Cs have been raised and repeated, our discussions have not resulted in consensus about whether or not to define this new address type.  This document will summarize the arguments for and against the allocation of ULA-Cs, in an attempt to help the IETF IPv6 community reach a decision on this issue.</description>
