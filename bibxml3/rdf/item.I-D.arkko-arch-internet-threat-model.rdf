    <description>Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected against outside observers and attackers.  This memo suggests that the existing threat model, while important and still valid, is no longer alone sufficient to cater for the pressing security issues in the Internet.  For instance, it is also necessary to protect systems against endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with the interests of the users.  While such protection is difficult, there are some measures that can be taken.  It is particularly important to ensure that as we continue to develop Internet technology, non-communications security related threats are properly understood.  While the consideration of these issues is relatively new in the IETF, this memo provides some initial ideas about potential broader threat models to consider when designing protocols for the Internet or when trying to defend against pervasive monitoring.  Further down the road, updated threat models could result in changes in RFC 3552 (guidelines for writing security considerations) and RFC 7258 (pervasive monitoring), to include proper consideration of non-communications security threats.  It may also be necessary to have dedicated guidance on how systems design and architecture affects security.</description>
