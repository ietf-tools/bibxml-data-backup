    <description>This document specifies how to combine a Backward Recursive or Hierarchical method with inter-domain paths in the context of stateful Path Computation Element (PCE).  It relies on the PCInitiate message to set up independent paths per domain.  Combining these different paths together enables to operate them as end-to-end inter- domain paths without the need for a signaling session between inter- domain border routers.  A new Stitching Label is defined, new Path Setup Types, a new Association Type and a new PCEP communication Protocol (PCEP) Capability are considered for that purpose.</description>
