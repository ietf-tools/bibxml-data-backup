    <description>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides end-to-end absolute delay and loss guarantee to serve real-time applications. DetNet is focused on a general approach that use techniques such as 1) data plane resources reservation for DetNet flows; 2) providing fixed path for DetNet flows; 3)sequentializng, replicating, and eliminating duplicate packets transmission [draft-ietf-detnet- architecture-00] to guarantee the worst case delay of DetNet flow while allow sharing among best effort traffic. Data flow information model is important to the DetNet work that it defines information be used by flow establishment and control protocols. This document describes and DetNet flow information model that represents the flow identifier, traffic description information so that can make resource reservation and provide differentiate service.</description>
