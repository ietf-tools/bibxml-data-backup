    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-goldman-ieprep-comparison-00.txt</link>
    <description>This document provides a high level conceptual discussion on the significant modeling differences affecting the treatment of a POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) call, a GETS (Government Emergency Telephone Service) call, and an MLPP (Multilevel Priority and Preemption) call in the traditional voice PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network). The genesis for this discussion on these services is primarily from experience with the United States capabilities and it is appreciated that these types of calls may be very different or non-existent in other regions of the world. Still, it may be useful to provide this discussion as a background, which may be useful in understanding the legacy operations as the chartered ieprep work progresses. It should be made clear from the onset that this document suggests no requirements or solutions, but is merely informative about the tradition voice network treatments.</description>
