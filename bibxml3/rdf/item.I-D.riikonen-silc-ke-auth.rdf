    <description>This memo describes two protocols used in the Secure Internet Live Conferencing (SILC) protocol, specified in the Secure Internet Live Conferencing, Protocol Specification [SILC1].  The SILC Key Exchange (SKE) protocol provides secure key exchange between two parties resulting into shared secret key material.  The protocol is based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm and its functionality is derived from several key exchange protocols.  The second protocol, SILC Connection Authentication protocol provides user level authentication used when creating connections in SILC network.  The protocol supports passphrase (pre-shared secret) authentication and public key (and certificate) authentication based on digital signatures.</description>
