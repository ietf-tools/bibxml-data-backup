    <description>This document describes the use cases of multiple provisioning domain (MPVD) in homenet.  Although most residential networks nowadays are connected to a single ISP and normally subscribed to standard internet service, it is expected that much wider range of devices and services will become common in home networks.  Homenet defines such home network topologies with increasing number of devices with the assumption that it requires minimum configuration by residential user.  As described in the homenet architecture ([RFC7368]), multihoming and multi-service residential network will be more common in the near future.  Nodes in such network may commonly have multiple interfaces or subscribe to multiple services.  Potential types of PVD-aware nodes concerning interface and service specific provisioning domains are introduced in this document.  Based on this, different MPVD configuration examples are given.  These examples illustrate how PVD may be implemented in home network.  PVDs provide independent provisioning domains for different interfaces and services, which enables robust and flexible network configuration for these networks.</description>
