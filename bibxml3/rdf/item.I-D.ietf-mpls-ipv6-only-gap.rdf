    <title>"Gap Analysis for Operating IPv6-only MPLS Networks", Wesley George, Carlos Pignataro</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-mpls-ipv6-only-gap-04.txt</link>
    <description>This document reviews the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol suite in the context of IPv6 and identifies gaps that must be addressed in order to allow MPLS-related protocols and applications to be used with IPv6-only networks.  This document is intended to focus on gaps in the standards defining the MPLS suite, and not to highlight particular vendor implementations (or lack thereof) in the context of IPv6-only MPLS functionality.  In the data plane, MPLS fully supports IPv6 and MPLS labeled packets can be carried over IPv6 packets in a variety of encapsulations. However, support for IPv6 among MPLS control plane protocols, MPLS applications, MPLS Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), and MIB modules is mixed, with some protocols having major gaps.  For most major gaps work is in progress to upgrade the relevant protocols.</description>
