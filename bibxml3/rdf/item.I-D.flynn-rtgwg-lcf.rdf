    <description>This Internet Draft describes the Limited Core Fix (LCF) multicast t protocol for IP multicast routing. Since the existing multicast protocols rely on RFC 1112 as their foundation, multicast is characterized by a host join attribute not involving knowledge by the source. Evolving uses of multicast may be seen to require joins on a more qualified basis and may require knowledge of such joins by the source. An example, is IP wireless multicast in which the source (i.e., service provider) will want to charge for specific channels (in the TV sense) and limit transmission to those hosts paying for the service. Other qualifications may be needed in providing high quality broadband service. Other examples for which a qualification- based multicast could be developed include bandwidth needs, jitter or latency requirements, or restrictions on who gets particular transmissions. In order to accommodate these requirements, or a dynamic group membership for collaboration activities. The qualification-based multicast described in LCF uses a depth-first- search technique to find new routes to a multicast source when needed, an attribute that minimizes transmission bandwidth to update the tree and utilizes tables significantly smaller than those of normal multicast. The draft discusses the notion of qualification- based multicast as a generalization of Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing for multicast. LCF can be used to build multicast trees in a sparse-mode fashion and implements receiver-initiated multicast repair for damaged multicast trees.</description>
