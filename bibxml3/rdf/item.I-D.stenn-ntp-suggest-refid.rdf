    <title>"Network Time Protocol Suggested REFID Extension Field", Harlan Stenn</title>

    <description>NTP's Reference ID, or REFID, identifies the source of time in a timestamp or time packet.  In NTP packets sent over the network the REFID is used to identify the "system peer", and in the long-term general case its fundamental purpose is to prevent a one-degree timing loop.  Each instance of NTP decides for itself what REFID it will put in its outgoing packets, and there is currently no way for an external time source to tell or recommend this value in the case where that external time source is selected as the "system peer."  The SUGGESTED-REFID NTP Extension Field proposal is a backward- compatible way for a time source to tell its peers or clients "If you use me as your system peer, use this nonce as your REFID."</description>
