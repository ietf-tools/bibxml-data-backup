    <description>Diameter has received wide acceptance in large scale networking based on applications like Network Access Server and Credit Control. Different Standards Development Organizations consider Diameter as base protocol for extended applications, e.g. to push or pull information between a Diameter client and server without alignment of application states and identification schemes with the Session-ID concept as utilized by the Diameter protocol.  The use of Diameter bulk signaling to enable transmission of multi-user context with a single or few messages for application state recovery after failure represents a further use case, which requires investigation on its impact to the Diameter base specification.  This document analyzes various use cases for Diameter bulk signaling and assesses practices to enable operation of such use cases from extended or new applications.</description>
