    <title>"Recommendations for the use of whitelists for email senders transmitting email over IPv6", Terry Zink</title>
    <link>http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-tzink-ipv6mail-whitelist-02.txt</link>
    <description>This document contains a plan for how providers of email services can manage one aspect of the problem of email abuse over IPv6. Spammers can send mail from a very large range of IPv6 addresses, and this will make current antispam blocklisting technology less effective.  This is because email receivers will have to maintain excessively large lists of IP blocklists which either consume too many resources, or will become stale and therefore ineffective as spammers quickly discard one IP address and move onto the next one.  This document recommends that during the transition of email from IPv4 to IPv6, email receivers implement a whitelisting option where they only allow email from permitted senders over IPv6 and reject or throttle email from everyone else sending email over IPv6.</description>
