    <description>IVI, IVI + DHCPv6, 1:N IVI, Bidirectional NAT, and SIPNAT have been proposed to global Internet access to IPv6-only domains.  These methods are not all mutually exclusive, and we propose that IVI (along with its variants) along with SIPNAT may be considered together as a more complete solution for enabling access from today's IPv4 global Internet into IPv6-only domains.  This would likely have the effect of accelerating the adoption of IPv6, since with such access enablements there would be much reduced incentive for new deployments to require IPv4 addressability.  As part of the discussion, we also include a comparison of the various techniques so the relative trade-offs may be more easily understood.</description>
