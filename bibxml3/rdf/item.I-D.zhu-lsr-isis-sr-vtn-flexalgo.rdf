        <description>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements.  VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics provided by the underlay network.  A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of network resources allocated from the physical network.  A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services.  The topological constraints of a VTN can be defined using Flex-Algo. In some network scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique Flex-Algo, and the set of network resources allocated to a VTN can be instantiated as layer-2 sub-interfaces or member links of the layer-3 interfaces.  This document describes the mechanisms to build the SR based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo and IGP L2 bundle with minor extensions.</description>
