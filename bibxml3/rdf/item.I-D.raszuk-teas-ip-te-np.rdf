    <description>This document describes a control plane based IP Traffic Engineering Architecture where path information is kept in the control plane by selected nodes instead of being inserted into each packet on ingress of an administrative domain.  The described proposal is also fully compatible with the concept of network programming.  It is positioned as a complimentary technique to native SRv6 and can be used when there are concerns with increased packet size due to depth of SID stack, possible concerns regarding exceeding MTU or more strict simplicity requirements typically seen in number of enterprise networks.  The proposed solution is applicable to both IPv4 or IPv6 based networks.  As an additional added value, detection of end to end path liveness as well as dynamic path selection based on real time path quality is integrated from day one in the design.</description>
