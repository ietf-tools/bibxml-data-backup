    <description>WebRTC, Web Real-Time Communications, is a set of protocols and APIs used to enable web developers to add real-time communications into their web pages and applications with a few lines of JavaScript. WebRTC media flows are encrypted and authenticated by SRTP, the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol while the key agreement is provided by DTLS-SRTP, Datagram Transport Layer Security for Secure Real-time Transport Protocol.  However, without some third party identity service or certificate authority, WebRTC media flows have no protection against a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.  ZRTP, Media Path Key Agreement for Unicast Secure RTP, RFC 6189, does provide protection against MitM attackers using key continuity augmented with a Short Authentication String (SAS).  This specification describes how ZRTP can be used over the WebRTC data channel to provide MitM protection for WebRTC media flows keyed using DTLS-SRTP.  This provides users protection against MitM attackers without requiring browsers to support ZRTP or users to download a plugin or extension to implement ZRTP.</description>
