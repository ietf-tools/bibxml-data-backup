    <description>A network routing protocol like BGP is typically configured and results of its operation are analyzed through some form of Command Line Interface (CLI) or NETCONF.  These interactions to control BGP and diagnose its operation encompass: configuration of protocol parameters, display of protocol data, setting of certain protocol state and debugging of the protocol.  Interface to the Routing System's (IRS) Programmatic interfaces, as defined in [I-D.ward-irs-framework], provides an alternate way to control the configuration and diagnose the operation of the BGP protocol.  IRS may be used for the configuration, manipulation, polling or analyzing protocol data.  This document describes set of use cases for which IRS can be used for BGP protocol.  It is intended to provide a base for the solution draft describing a set of interfaces to the BGP protocol.</description>
