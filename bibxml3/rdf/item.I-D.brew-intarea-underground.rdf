    <description>When users are at known underground locations, such as tube stations they often do not have a GPS signal, as the radio waves from the satellites required cannot penetrate the earth, this draft suggests providing GPS locations over WiFI using remote IP detection for a server to respond with the correct name of clients location and the clients GPS location.IP address.   Extending this to those without WiFI access the standard goes one stage further, by offering a hidden WiFI network with a standard name, such as .location. The principle being that mobile devices can look for this network in cases where GPS data cannot be collected. It is hoped that this will allow those using mapping services to know where they are when travelling on underground trains etc.</description>
