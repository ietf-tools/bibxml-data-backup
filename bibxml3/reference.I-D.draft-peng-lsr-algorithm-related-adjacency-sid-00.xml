<abstract><t>Segment Routing architecture supports the use of multiple routing algorithms, i.e, different constraint-based shortest-path calculations can be supported.  There are two standard algorithms: SPF and Strict-SPF, defined in Segment Routing architecture.  There are also other user defined algorithms according to Flex-algo applicaiton.  However, an algorithm identifier is often included as part of a Prefix-SID advertisement, that maybe not satisfy some scenarios where multiple algorithm share the same link resource. This document will complement that the algorithm identifier can be also included as part of a Adjacency-SID advertisement</t></abstract>
