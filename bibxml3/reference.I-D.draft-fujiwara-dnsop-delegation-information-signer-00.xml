<abstract><t>DNSSEC does not protect delegation information, it contains NS RRSet on the parent side and glue records.  This document defines delegation information signer (DiS) resource record for protecting the delegation information, by inserting on the parent side of zone cut to hold a hash of delegation information.  The DiS resource record reuses the type code and wire format of DS resource record, and distinguishes it from existing DS RRSet by using a new digest type.  This document also describes the usage of DiS resource record and shows the implications on security-aware resolvers.  The definition and usage are compatible with current DNSSEC.</t></abstract>
