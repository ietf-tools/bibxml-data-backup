<abstract><t>Network virtualization involves the cooperation of devices with a wide variety of capabilities such as software and hardware tunnel endpoints, transit fabrics, and centralized control clusters.  As a result of their role in tying together different elements in the system, the requirements on tunnels are influenced by all of these components.  Flexibility is therefore the most important aspect of a tunnel protocol if it is to keep pace with the evolution of the system.  This draft describes Geneve, a protocol designed to recognize and accommodate these changing capabilities and needs.</t></abstract>
