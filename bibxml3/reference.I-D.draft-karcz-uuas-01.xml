<abstract><t>User-Agent is a HTTP request-header field. It contains information about the user agent originating the request, which is often used by servers to help identify the scope of reported interoperability problems, to work around or tailor responses to avoid particular user agent limitations, and for analytics regarding browser or operating system use. Over the years contents of this field got complicated and ambiguous. That was the reaction for sending altered version of websites to web browsers other than popular ones. During the development of the WWW, authors of the new web browsers used to construct User-Agent strings similar to Netscape's one. Nowadays contents of the User-Agent field are much longer than 15 years ago. This Memo proposes the Uniform User-Agent String as a way to simplify the User-Agent field contents, while maintaining the previous possibility of their use.</t></abstract>
