<abstract><t>The S/MIME protocols Message Specification (RFC 5751), Cryptographic Message Syntax (RFC 5652), S/MIME Certificate Handling (RFC 5750) and Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME (RFC 2634) specify a consistent way to securely send and receive MIME messages providing end to end integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and confidentiality.  This document identifies a number of interoperability, technical, procedural and policy related issues that may result in end-to-end security services not being achievable.  To resolve such issues, this document profiles domain-based signing and encryption using S/MIME, such as specifying how S/MIME signing and encryption can be applied between a Message Submission Agent (MSA) and a Message Delivery Agent (MDA) or between 2 Message Transfer Agents (MTA).</t><t> This document is also registering 2 URI scheme: &quot;smtp&quot; and &quot;submit&quot; which are used for designating SMTP/SMTP Submission servers (respectively), as well as SMTP/Submission client accounts.</t></abstract>
