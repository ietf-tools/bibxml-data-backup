<abstract><t>In a dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) environment, the procedures of RFC 3263 by which a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) client contacts a server may not suffice to provide a good user experience.  This document describes "Happy Eyeballs" modifications -- modifications of the procedures of RFC 3263, as well as additional client procedures -- which improve the SIP user experience in many circumstances.</t></abstract>
