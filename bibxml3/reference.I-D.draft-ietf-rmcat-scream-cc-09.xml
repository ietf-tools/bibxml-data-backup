<abstract><t>This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational media services such as video.  The solution conforms to the packet conservation principle and uses a hybrid loss and delay based congestion control algorithm.  The algorithm is evaluated over both simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as well as in a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system simulator and is shown to achieve both low latency and high video throughput in these scenarios.</t></abstract>
