<abstract><t>This document provides some exemplary use cases for service function chaining in mobile service provider networks.  The objective of this draft is not to cover all conceivable service chains in detail. Rather, the intention is to localize and explain the application domain of service chaining within mobile networks as far as it is required to complement the SFC problem statement and architecture framework of the working group.  Service function chains typically reside in a LAN segment which links the mobile access network to the actual application platforms located in the carrier's datacenters or somewhere else in the Internet. Service function chains (SFC) ensure a fair distribution of network resources according to agreed service policies, enhance the performance of service delivery or take care of security and privacy. SFCs may also include Value Added Services (VAS).  Commonly, SFCs are typical middle box based services.  General considerations and specific use cases are presented in this document to demonstrate the different technical requirements of these goals for service function chaining in mobile service provider networks.  The specification of service function chaining for mobile networks must take into account an interaction between service function chains and the 3GPP Policy and Charging Control (PCC) environment.</t></abstract>
