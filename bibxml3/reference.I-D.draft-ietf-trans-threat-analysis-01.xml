<abstract><t>This document describes an attack model for the Web PKI context in which security mechanisms to detect mis-issuance of web site certificates will be developed. The model provides an analysis of detection and remediation mechanisms for both syntactic and semantic mis-issuance. The model introduces an outline of attacks to organize the discussion. The model also describes the roles played by the elements of the Certificate Transparency (CT) system, to establish a context for the model.</t></abstract>
