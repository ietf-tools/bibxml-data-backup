<abstract><t>This document describes two reference video traffic source models for evaluating RMCAT candidate algorithms.  The first model statistically characterizes the behavior of a live video encoder in response to changing requests on target video rate.  The second model is trace- driven, and emulates the encoder output by scaling the pre-encoded video frame sizes from a widely used video test sequence.  Both models are designed to strike a balance between simplicity, repeatability, and authenticity in modeling the interactions between a video traffic source and the congestion control module.</t></abstract>
