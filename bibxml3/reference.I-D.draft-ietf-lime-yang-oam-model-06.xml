<abstract><t>This document presents a base YANG Data model for connection oriented OAM protocols.  It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for connection oriented protocols.  Based model presented here can be extended to include technology specific details.  This is leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and support nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different levels through a unified interface).</t></abstract>
