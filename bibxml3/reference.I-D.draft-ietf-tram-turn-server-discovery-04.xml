<abstract><t>Current Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server discovery mechanisms are relatively static and limited to explicit configuration.  These are usually under the administrative control of the application or TURN service provider, and not the enterprise, ISP, or the network in which the client is located.  Enterprises and ISPs wishing to provide their own TURN servers need auto discovery mechanisms that a TURN client could use with no or minimal configuration.  This document describes three such mechanisms for TURN server discovery.</t></abstract>
