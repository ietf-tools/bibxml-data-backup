<abstract><t>This document describes an Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP) in conformance with the Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA).  The AMP provides monitoring and configuration services between managing devices (Managers) and managed devices (Agents), some of which may operate on the far side of high-delay or high-disruption links.  The AMP reduces the number of transmitted bytes, operates without sessions or (concurrent) two-way links, and functions autonomously when there is no timely contact with a network operator.  The AMP accomplishes this without requiring mobile code.</t></abstract>
