<abstract><t>Constrained Devices as they are used in the "Internet of Things" need security.  One important element of this security is that devices in the Internet of Things need to be able to decide which operations requested of them should be considered authorized, need to ascertain that the authorization to request the operation does apply to the actual requester, and need to ascertain that other devices they place requests on are the ones they intended.  On the ACE mailing list, an activity to create specifications for such authenticated authorization for constrained devices is contemplated, leading to protocol proposals such as [I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize] or [I-D.ietf-ace-oscore-profile].  One potential work item complementing this protocol work is an Authorization Information Format (AIF).  This document provides a strawman for such a format that should enable further discussion of the objectives for its development.</t></abstract>
