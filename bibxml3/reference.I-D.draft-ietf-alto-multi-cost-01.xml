<abstract><t>The ALTO (Application Layer-Traffic Optimization) Protocol ([RFC7285]) defines several services that return various metrics describing the costs between network endpoints.  For example, when downloading a file that is mirrored on several sites, a user application may use these ALTO cost metrics to determine the most efficient mirror site.  An ALTO Server may offer a variety of cost metrics, based on latency, bandwidth, hop count, jitter, or whatever else the ALTO Server deems useful.  When selecting a mirror site, a client may consider more than one metric, perhaps trading bandwidth for latency.  While the base ALTO Protocol allows a client to use more than one cost metric, to do so, the client must request each metric separately.  This document defines a new service that allows a client to retrieve several cost metrics with one request, which is considerably more efficient.  In addition, this document extends the ALTO constraint tests to allow a user to specify an arbitrary logical combination of tests on several cost metrics.</t></abstract>
