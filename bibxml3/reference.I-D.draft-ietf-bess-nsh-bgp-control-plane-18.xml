<abstract><t>This document describes the use of BGP as a control plane for networks that support Service Function Chaining (SFC).  The document introduces a new BGP address family called the SFC Address Family Identifier / Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SFC AFI/SAFI) with two route types.  One route type is originated by a node to advertise that it hosts a particular instance of a specified service function. This route type also provides &quot;instructions&quot; on how to send a packet to the hosting node in a way that indicates that the service function has to be applied to the packet.  The other route type is used by a Controller to advertise the paths of &quot;chains&quot; of service functions, and to give a unique designator to each such path so that they can be used in conjunction with the Network Service Header defined in RFC 8300.</t><t> This document adopts the SFC architecture described in RFC 7665.</t></abstract>
