<abstract><t>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance assessment.  The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as either &quot;Active&quot; or &quot;Passive&quot;.  Some methods may use a subset of both Active and Passive attributes, and we refer to these as &quot;Hybrid Methods&quot;.  This memo also describes multiple dimensions to help evaluate new methods as they emerge.</t></abstract>
