<abstract><t>This document presents a technique for using a Markdown syntax variant, called Pandoc, and a bit of XML (as defined in RFC 2629) as a source format for documents that are Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) or RFCs.</t><t>The goal of this technique (which is called Pandoc2rfc) is to let an author of an I-D focus on the main body of text without being distracted too much by XML tags; however, it does not alleviate the need to typeset some files in XML.</t></abstract>
