        <title>RFC 5661: Network File System (NFS) Version 4 Minor Version 1 Protocol, S. Shepler, M. Eisler, D. Noveck</title>
        <dc:date>2010-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the Network File System (NFS) version 4 minor version 1, including features retained from the base protocol (NFS version 4 minor version 0, which is specified in RFC 3530) and protocol extensions made subsequently.  Major extensions introduced in NFS version 4 minor version 1 include Sessions, Directory Delegations, and parallel NFS (pNFS).  NFS version 4 minor version 1 has no dependencies on NFS version 4 minor version 0, and it is considered a separate protocol.  Thus, this document neither updates nor obsoletes RFC 3530.  NFS minor version 1 is deemed superior to NFS minor version 0 with no loss of functionality, and its use is preferred over version 0.  Both NFS minor versions 0 and 1 can be used simultaneously on the same network, between the same client and server.  [STANDARDS-TRACK] </description>
