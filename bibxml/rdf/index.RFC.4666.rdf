        <title>RFC 4666: Signaling System 7 (SS7) Message Transfer Part 3 (MTP3) - User Adaptation Layer (M3UA), K. Morneault, J. Pastor-Balbas</title>
        <dc:date>2006-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7 MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol.  Also, provision is made for protocol elements that enable a seamless operation of the MTP3-User peers in the SS7 and IP domains.  This protocol would be used between a Signalling Gateway (SG) and a Media Gateway Controller (MGC) or IP-resident Database, or between two IP-based applications.  It is assumed that the SG receives SS7 signalling over a standard SS7 interface using the SS7 Message Transfer Part (MTP) to provide transport.  This document obsoletes RFC 3332.
