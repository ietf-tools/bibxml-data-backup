        <title>RFC 3695: Compact Forward Error Correction (FEC) Schemes, M. Luby, L. Vicisano</title>
        <dc:date>2004-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document introduces some Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes that supplement the FEC schemes described in RFC 3452.  The primary benefits of these additional FEC schemes are that they are designed for reliable bulk delivery of large objects using a more compact FEC Payload ID, and they can be used to sequentially deliver blocks of an object of indeterminate length.  Thus, they more flexibly support different delivery models with less packet header overhead.  This document also describes the Fully-Specified FEC scheme corresponding to FEC Encoding ID 0.  This Fully-Specified FEC scheme requires no FEC coding and is introduced primarily to allow simple interoperability testing between different implementations of protocol instantiations that use the FEC building block.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
