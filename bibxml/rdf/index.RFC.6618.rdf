        <title>RFC 6618: Mobile IPv6 Security Framework Using Transport Layer Security for Communication between the Mobile Node and Home Agent, J. Korhonen, B. Patil, H. Tschofenig, D. Kroeselberg</title>

        <description>Mobile IPv6 signaling between a Mobile Node (MN) and its Home Agent (HA) is secured using IPsec.  The security association (SA) between an MN and the HA is established using Internet Key Exchange Protocol (IKE) version 1 or 2.  The security model specified for Mobile IPv6, which relies on IKE/IPsec, requires interaction between the Mobile IPv6 protocol component and the IKE/IPsec module of the IP stack. This document proposes an alternate security framework for Mobile IPv6 and Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6, which relies on Transport Layer Security for establishing keying material and other bootstrapping parameters required to protect Mobile IPv6 signaling and data traffic between the MN and HA.  This document defines an Experimental Protocol  for the Internet community. </description>
