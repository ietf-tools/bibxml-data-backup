        <title>RFC 6058: Transient Binding for Proxy Mobile IPv6, M. Liebsch, A. Muhanna, O. Blume</title>
        <dc:date>2011-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a mechanism that enhances Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol signaling to support the creation of a transient binding cache entry that is used to optimize the performance of dual radio handover, as well as single radio handover.  This mechanism is applicable to the mobile node's inter-MAG (Mobility Access Gateway) handover while using a single interface or different interfaces.  The handover problem space using the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol is analyzed and the use of transient binding cache entries at the local mobility anchor is described.  The specified extension to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol ensures optimized forwarding of downlink as well as uplink packets between mobile nodes and the network infrastructure and avoids superfluous packet forwarding delay or even packet loss. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
