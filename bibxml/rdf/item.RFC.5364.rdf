        <title>RFC 5364: Extensible Markup Language (XML) Format Extension for Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists, M. Garcia-Martin, G. Camarillo</title>
        <dc:date>2008-10-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>In certain types of multimedia communications, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request is distributed to a group of SIP User Agents (UAs).  The sender sends a single SIP request to a server which further distributes the request to the group.  This SIP request contains a list of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), which identify the recipients of the SIP request.  This URI list is expressed as a resource list XML document.  This specification defines an XML extension to the XML resource list format that allows the sender of the request to qualify a recipient with a copy control level similar to the copy control level of existing email systems.
