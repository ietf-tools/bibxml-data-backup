        <title>RFC 4058: Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA) Requirements, A. Yegin, Y. Ohba, R. Penno, G. Tsirtsis, C. Wang</title>

        <description>It is expected that future IP devices will have a variety of access technologies to gain network connectivity.  Currently there are access-specific mechanisms for providing client information to the network for authentication and authorization purposes.  In addition to being limited to specific access media (e.g., 802.1X for IEEE 802 links), some of these protocols are limited to specific network topologies (e.g., PPP for point-to-point links).  The goal of this document is to identify the requirements for a link-layer agnostic protocol that allows a host and a network to authenticate each other for network access.  This protocol will run between a client's device and an agent in the network where the agent might be a client of the AAA infrastructure.  This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
