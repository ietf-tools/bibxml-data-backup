        <title>RFC 4084: Terminology for Describing Internet Connectivity, J. Klensin</title>
        <dc:date>2005-05-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>As the Internet has evolved, many types of arrangements have been advertised and sold as "Internet connectivity".  Because these may differ significantly in the capabilities they offer, the range of options, and the lack of any standard terminology, the effort to distinguish between these services has caused considerable consumer confusion.  This document provides a list of terms and definitions that may be helpful to providers, consumers, and, potentially, regulators in clarifying the type and character of services being offered.  This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements. </description>
