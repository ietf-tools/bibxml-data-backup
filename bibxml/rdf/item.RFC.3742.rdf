        <title>RFC 3742: Limited Slow-Start for TCP with Large Congestion Windows, S. Floyd</title>
        <dc:date>2004-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows.  For TCP connections that are able to use congestion windows of thousands (or tens of thousands) of MSS-sized segments (for MSS the sender's MAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start procedure can result in increasing the congestion window by thousands of segments in a single round-trip time.  Such an increase can easily result in thousands of packets being dropped in one round-trip time.  This is often counter-productive for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard on the rest of the traffic sharing the congested link.  This note describes Limited Slow-Start as an optional mechanism for limiting the number of segments by which the congestion window is increased for one window of data during slow-start, in order to improve performance for TCP connections with large congestion windows.  This memo defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community. </description>
