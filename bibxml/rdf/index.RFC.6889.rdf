        <title>RFC 6889: Analysis of Stateful 64 Translation, R. Penno, T. Saxena, M. Boucadair, S. Sivakumar</title>

        <description>Due to specific problems, Network Address Translation - Protocol Translation (NAT-PT) was deprecated by the IETF as a mechanism to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.  Since then, new efforts have been undertaken within IETF to standardize alternative mechanisms to perform IPv6-IPv4 translation.  This document analyzes to what extent the new stateful translation mechanisms avoid the problems that caused the IETF to deprecate NAT-PT. </description>
