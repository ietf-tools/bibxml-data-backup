        <title>RFC 6480: An Infrastructure to Support Secure Internet Routing, M. Lepinski, S. Kent</title>
        <dc:date>2012-02-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes an architecture for an infrastructure to support improved security of Internet routing.  The foundation of this architecture is a Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) that represents the allocation hierarchy of IP address space and Autonomous System (AS) numbers; and a distributed repository system for storing and disseminating the data objects that comprise the RPKI, as well as other signed objects necessary for improved routing security.  As an initial application of this architecture, the document describes how a legitimate holder of IP address space can explicitly and verifiably authorize one or more ASes to originate routes to that address space.  Such verifiable authorizations could be used, for example, to more securely construct BGP route filters.   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
