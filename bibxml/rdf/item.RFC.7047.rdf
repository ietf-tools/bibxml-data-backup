        <title>RFC 7047: The Open vSwitch Database Management Protocol, B. Pfaff, B. Davie</title>
        <dc:date>2013-12-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Open vSwitch is an open-source software switch designed to be used as a vswitch (virtual switch) in virtualized server environments.  A vswitch forwards traffic between different virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical host and also forwards traffic between VMs and the physical network.  Open vSwitch is open to programmatic extension and control using OpenFlow and the OVSDB (Open vSwitch Database) management protocol.  This document defines the OVSDB management protocol.  The Open vSwitch project includes open-source OVSDB client and server implementations. </description>
