        <title>RFC 7707: Network Reconnaissance in IPv6 Networks, F. Gont, T. Chown</title>
        <dc:date>2016-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4 counterpart.  An IPv6 subnet of size /64 can (in theory) accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than is typical in IPv4 networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or fewer unique addresses.  As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous effort to perform address-scanning attacks against IPv6 networks; therefore, IPv6 address-scanning attacks have been considered unfeasible.  This document formally obsoletes RFC 5157, which first discussed this assumption, by providing further analysis on how traditional address-scanning techniques apply to IPv6 networks and exploring some additional techniques that can be employed for IPv6 network reconnaissance. </description>
