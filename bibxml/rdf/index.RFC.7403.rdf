        <title>RFC 7403: A Media-Based Traceroute Function for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H. Kaplan</title>
        <dc:date>2014-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field to determine the reachability path of requests to a target.  A mechanism for media-loopback calls has also been defined separately, which enables test calls to be generated that result in media being looped back to the originator.  This document describes a means of performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-loopback mechanism to test the media path when SIP sessions go through media-relaying back-to-back user agents (B2BUAs). </description>
