        <title>RFC 3460: Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) Extensions, B. Moore</title>
        <dc:date>2003-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document specifies a number of changes to the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM, RFC 3060).  Two types of changes are included. First, several completely new elements are introduced, for example, classes for header filtering, that extend PCIM into areas that it did not previously cover.  Second, there are cases where elements of PCIM (for example, policy rule priorities) are deprecated, and replacement elements are defined (in this case, priorities tied to associations that refer to policy rules).  Both types of changes are done in such a way that, to the extent possible, interoperability with implementations of the original PCIM model is preserved.  This document updates RFC 3060.
