        <title>RFC 8219: Benchmarking Methodology for IPv6 Transition Technologies, M. Georgescu, L. Pislaru, G. Lencse</title>
        <dc:date>2017-08-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Benchmarking methodologies that address the performance of network interconnect devices that are IPv4- or IPv6-capable exist, but the IPv6 transition technologies are outside of their scope. This document provides complementary guidelines for evaluating the performance of IPv6 transition technologies.  More specifically, this document targets IPv6 transition technologies that employ encapsulation or translation mechanisms, as dual-stack nodes can be tested using the recommendations of RFCs 2544 and 5180. The methodology also includes a metric for benchmarking load scalability. </description>
