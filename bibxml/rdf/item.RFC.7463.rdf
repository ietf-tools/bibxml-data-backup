        <title>RFC 7463: Shared Appearances of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Address of Record (AOR), A. Johnston, M. Soroushnejad, V. Venkataramanan</title>
        <dc:date>2015-03-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes the requirements and implementation of a group telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA) or Multiple Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA).  When implemented using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as shared appearances of an Address of Record (AOR) since SIP does not have the concept of lines.  This feature is commonly offered in IP Centrex services and IP Private Branch Exchange (IPBX) offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers used in a business environment.  This feature allows several user agents (UAs) to share a common AOR, learn about calls placed and received by other UAs in the group, and pick up or join calls within the group.  This document discusses use cases, lists requirements, and defines extensions to implement this feature.  This specification updates RFCs 3261 and 4235. </description>
