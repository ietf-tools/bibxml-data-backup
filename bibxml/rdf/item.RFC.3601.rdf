        <title>RFC 3601: Text String Notation for Dial Sequences and Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) / E.164 Addresses, C. Allocchio</title>
        <dc:date>2003-09-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This memo describes the full set of notations needed to represent a text string in a Dial Sequence.  A Dial Sequence is normally composed of Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF) elements, plus separators and additional "actions" (such as "wait for dialtone", "pause for N secs", etc.) which could be needed to successfully establish the connection with the target service:  this includes the cases where subaddresses or DTMF menu navigation apply. </description>
