        <title>RFC 5594: Report from the IETF Workshop on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Infrastructure, May 28, 2008, J. Peterson, A. Cooper</title>

        <description>This document reports the outcome of a workshop organized by the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure Area Directors of the IETF to discuss network delay and congestion issues resulting from increased Peer-to-Peer (P2P) traffic volumes.  The workshop was held on May 28, 2008 at MIT in Cambridge, MA, USA.  The goals of the workshop were twofold: to understand the technical problems that ISPs and end users are experiencing as a result of high volumes of P2P traffic, and to begin to understand how the IETF may be helpful in addressing these problems.  Gaining an understanding of where in the IETF this work might be pursued and how to extract feasible work items were highlighted as important tasks in pursuit of the latter goal.  The workshop was very well attended and produced several work items that have since been taken up by members of the IETF community.   This memo provides information for the Internet community. </description>
