        <title>RFC 8067: Updating When Standards Track Documents May Refer Normatively to Documents at a Lower Level, B. Leiba</title>
        <dc:date>2017-01-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>RFC 3967 specifies a process for allowing normative references to documents at lower maturity levels ("downrefs"), which involves calling out the downref explicitly in the Last Call notice.  That requirement has proven to be unnecessarily strict, and this document updates RFC 3967, allowing the IESG more flexibility in accepting downrefs in Standards Track documents. </description>
