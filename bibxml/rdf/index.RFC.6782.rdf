        <title>RFC 6782: Wireline Incremental IPv6, V. Kuarsingh, L. Howard</title>
        <dc:date>2012-11-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for or deploying IPv6 in their networks.  These operators often face difficult challenges related to IPv6 introduction, along with those related to IPv4 run-out.  Operators will need to meet the simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support for IPv4 connectivity for legacy devices with a stagnant supply of IPv4 addresses.  The IPv6 transition will take most networks from an IPv4- only environment to an IPv6-dominant environment with long transition periods varying by operator.  This document helps provide a framework for wireline providers who are faced with the challenges of introducing IPv6 along with meeting the legacy needs of IPv4 connectivity, utilizing well-defined and commercially available IPv6 transition technologies.  This document is not an Internet Standards  Track specification; it is published for informational purposes. </description>
