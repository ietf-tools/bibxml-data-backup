        <title>RFC 7909: Securing Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) Objects with Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) Signatures, R. Kisteleki, B. Haberman</title>
        <dc:date>2016-06-01T23:00:00-00:00</dc:date>
        <description>This document describes a method that allows parties to electronically sign Routing Policy Specification Language objects and validate such electronic signatures.  This allows relying parties to detect accidental or malicious modifications of such objects.  It also allows parties who run Internet Routing Registries or similar databases, but do not yet have authentication (based on Routing Policy System Security) of the maintainers of certain objects, to verify that the additions or modifications of such database objects are done by the legitimate holder(s) of the Internet resources mentioned in those objects.  This document updates RFCs 2622 and 4012 to add the signature attribute to supported RPSL objects. </description>
