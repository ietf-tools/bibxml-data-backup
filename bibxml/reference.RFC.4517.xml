<title>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): Syntaxes and Matching Rules</title>
<author initials='S.' surname='Legg' fullname='S. Legg' role='editor'><organization /></author>
<date year='2006' month='June' />
<abstract><t>Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory, whose values may be transferred in the LDAP protocol, has a defined syntax that constrains the structure and format of its values.  The comparison semantics for values of a syntax are not part of the syntax definition but are instead provided through separately defined matching rules.  Matching rules specify an argument, an assertion value, which also has a defined syntax.  This document defines a base set of syntaxes and matching rules for use in defining attributes for LDAP directories.  [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t></abstract>
